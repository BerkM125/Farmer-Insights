The Turkey hard red winter wheat brought to Kansas
by Mennonites in 1874 quickly became the most
important crop in the state. Continued improvements by
breeding and modern technology for production have
kept Kansas the number one wheat state in the nation.
Hard red winter wheat has stayed important for so long
because its traits and pattern of growth and development
are best suited of all crops to the weather, soils, and other
conditions in the state. However, weather in Kansas is
less than ideal for wheat and, more than any other factor,
limits grain yields in the state. Wheat growers in Kansas
are highly knowledgeable and the soils are generally
excellent, but grain yields are only a fraction of the 100-
plus bushels per acre averages in some countries. The
weather also limits the production inputs — the seeding
rate, fertilizer, and pesticides — that can be used
economically for high Kansas wheat yields.
What are the plant traits that enabled Turkey wheat
and its successors, our present varieties, to become so
important in Kansas? No single trait has been identified,
and a combination of many different characteristics
seems to be involved. Winter wheat is a cool-season crop
and grows best under moderate temperatures, but it is
able to resist both cold and hot weather. This hardiness is
essential for wheat to endure the freezing temperatures of
winter, the late frosts of spring, the high temperatures of
June, and the droughts that can occur anytime. Because
of its winter growth habit, wheat is planted during fall,
becomes well established before winter, and “greens up”
and starts growing quickly when conditions are favorable
in spring. Winter wheat not only resists freezing
temperatures during winter, it needs the cold to joint and
flower so it can set grain in spring. Flowering also
requires the lengthening days of spring, so it doesn’t
occur until May, when the dangers of late frosts are
usually past. The root system of winter wheat extends
farther than that of any other wheat class, enabling the
plant to obtain moisture from deep in the soil profile in
times of drought. These growth and development traits
make wheat highly adaptable to Kansas conditions.
The planting date is only one of the many
management practices that are determined by the growth
and development patterns of wheat. The seeding rate, for
instance, sets the number of plants per acre and, along
with tillers per plant, kernels per tiller, and weight per
kernel, determines the yield of grain. A change to any of
these yield components, such as a reduction in the
tillering capacity, would change the seeding rate that is
needed for maximum production.
By knowing how a wheat plant grows and develops,
an understanding of why it responds as it does to
management and the environment can be gained. This
publication tells how the wheat plant grows and
develops. It also discusses some of the critical factors in
its development at different stages of growth.
Growth Stages from Germination
through Maturation
The growth and development of winter wheat are
divided into stages. Germination leads to seedlings, the
first stage of plant growth, followed by tillering,
overwintering, jointing, boot, heading, and flowering.
Maturation, or development of the grain, is divided into
milk, soft dough, hard dough, and physiological maturity,
the stage when kernel weight is maximum. Ripening, the
last stage, occurs as the grain loses moisture until it is
ready to harvest.
Germination and Seedling Emergence
Quality seed is essential for establishing a productive
stand. Seed should have at least 85 percent germination
and 56 pounds per bushel test weight and should not be
shriveled. Large seeds have little, if any, advantage over
normal, plump seeds when both are planted at equal
volume or weight.
A wheat seed begins germination by absorbing water
and oxygen. Adequate soil moisture and temperature are
needed for this to occur. Two parts of the wheat seed are of
greatest importance in germination. The embryo, or
“germ,” gives rise to the radicle, or the seedling root, and
the scutellum, or the first leaf. The other important part of
the seed is the endosperm, which contains food in the form
of starch and protein for germination and emergence.
The coleoptile, or second leaf, penetrates the soil and
results in emergence of the seedling, usually within 5 to 7
days after planting. If the seed is planted too deeply,
beyond the elongation distance of the coleoptile, seedlings
cannot emerge and a poor stand will occur. Semidwarf
wheat varieties form short coleoptiles as well as short
plants, and planting depth is particularly critical for them.
A firm seedbed assures good contact between the
seed and the soil. Inadequate soil moisture is probably
the major reason for planting seed deeply. If the soil
moisture runs out before the seedlings emerge, as can
happen after light rains, survival of the seedlings often
depends more on the stage of germination than the length
of the dry period. Seedlings from seeds that have
germinated for only one or two days can survive
desiccation and resume growth when moisture reoccurs,
but seedlings that are 4 or 5 days old probably will not
tolerate drying.
Growth and Development
3
The first roots on the wheat seedling are known as
primary or seminal roots and include the radicle
previously mentioned. Primary roots are usually
temporary in wheat, unless the other roots fail to develop
because of poor conditions. Only the main stem of a
wheat plant has primary roots, which may be retained
throughout the life of the plant. Most of the root system
throughout the life of a wheat plant consists of secondary
or crown roots that arise from underground nodes after
the seedling emerges. Many of the roots on the main stem
and all the roots on the tillers are secondary roots. The
functions of roots are to anchor the plant and absorb
water and mineral nutrients. Most of the roots are in the
plow layer, or top 6 inches of soil, but some penetrate as
far as 7 feet into the soil. Water and minerals actually are
absorbed through fine hairs on the roots’ surfaces.
Extensive distribution of roots through the soil and the
large surface area of the root hairs make the wheat plant
efficient and drought-resistant.
The Growing Point and Seedling Growth
All above-ground growth on a wheat plant comes
from a meristem termed the growing point. The growing
point contains the stem parts–nodes and internodes–and
the wheat head in miniature. It is protected by its
underground location until spring, when it
“differentiates” and the plant begins to joint and
eventually heads.
The third seedling leaf is the first foliage leaf. It and
the other foliage leaves — as many as five to seven in
spring wheat and 11 to 15 in winter wheat — are the site
of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process in which
small bodies called chloroplasts in cells of wheat leaves
produce food and energy from sunlight, water, and
carbon dioxide. All the foliage and grain produced by the
wheat plant comes from photosynthesis.
Tillers are shoots that develop from nodal buds on
older wheat shoots. The number of tillers is determined by
the seeding rate, soil moisture and fertility, temperature,
and variety. A winter wheat plant grown under usual
conditions will have three to six tillers. Tillers develop
soon after the seedling emerges from the soil and have all
the other growth stages of the main stem.
Tillering can be encouraged by planting early;
fertilizing with nitrogen; and, where possible, irrigating if
soil moisture is low. Late planting is particularly
disadvantageous because it reduces tillering and must be
compensated by higher seeding rates. Tillers are formed
only during the fall but make most of their growth in the
following spring.
Overwintering
Decreasing daylength and gradually falling
temperatures during fall prompt the wheat plant to
develop a high level of cold hardiness. Most varieties
also undergo a change from an upright to a prostrate
growth form. Hardiness usually is greatest during early
winter and is lost gradually as the season progresses.
Most winterkilling occurs during late winter, when warm
spells cause the plants to loose hardiness and then are
followed by cold fronts that cause the damage. Snow
provides excellent protection because it insulates the
plants from extreme cold and keeps them from
responding to warm spells. The critical plant part is the
growing point, which is protected partially by being
about 1 inch below the soil surface during winter. The
entire plant is killed by injury to the growing point,
which turns from a white, turgid appearance to a brown,
wilted appearance after it is frozen. Leaves often stay
green during mild winters, but freezing or “burning” of
leaves by cold has little effect on yield.
Tillering
Warming temperatures in late winter cause wheat to
“green up” and resume growth. Tillers that were initiated
in the previous fall grow rapidly and change back from
the prostrate form to an upright form as the sheaths, the
parts of the leaves that cover the stems, become longer.
Nitrogen fertilizer should be top-dressed at this time to
stimulate growth of the tillers, which will produce most
of the grain at harvest. The growing points are still at
their protected underground position at this stage, but
drought and other stresses may restrict growth of the
tillers. Herbicides such as 2,4-D stop development of the
tillers and should not be applied at this stage.
Jointing and Boot
Jointing, the development of nodes and internodes
that form the stem of the wheat plant, begins when
growth of the tillers is complete. This phase marks the
change from vegetative growth to reproductive growth
and is important for several reasons. Growth of the
internodes pushes the growing point above the soil, and
grazing must be halted so that it is not removed by
livestock. The elevated position of the growing point
along with the gradual loss of winterhardiness also makes
the plants increasingly susceptible to late frosts. The
growing point is the most susceptible of all plant parts to
frost at this stage. New tillers might replace tillers in
which the growing point has been damaged by frost, but
the yield usually is reduced substantially. The change
from vegetative to reproductive growth also is when the
maximum number of kernels that will be formed in the
head (spike) is determined, causing the yield at harvest to
be susceptible to stress at this stage.
Jointing does not occur until the plants have been
exposed to winter temperatures and begin spring growth.
Exposure to low winter temperatures is necessary to
induce jointing in winter wheat; without it, the plants
would continue to produce more leaves.

Splitting open the wheat stem during jointing shows
the growing point is well differentiated into the young
head. During the boot stage, the head is enclosed in the
flag leaf sheath at the top of the plant.
Heading and Flowering
At the heading stage, the spike emerges from the boot.
Within 1 to 7 days after heading, the flowering stage and
pollination occur, and the grain begins filling. Most plants,
including wheat, have very specific day-length
requirements for flowering. Wheat is classified as a longday plant because it will flower only when days are long
and nights, the important times, are short.
Flowering usually begins in the center of the spike
and progresses toward the ends and occurs 1 or 2 days
earlier on the main stem than on the tillers. Appearance
of the yellow anthers outside of the florets marks the
completion of flowering. The actual number of kernels
that will form in the spike is determined at this stage.
Wheat is highly self-pollinated and quite resistant to most
stresses except frost during flowering. Temperatures only
slightly below freezing quickly kill the male flower parts,
sterilizing the florets so no grain is formed. However,
only part of the spike might be sterilized because of the
variation in flowering, so grain might form on the center
or ends but not on the other parts.
Maturation and Ripening
The grain begins growing immediately after
flowering and reaches its maximum size (not weight)
within about 2 weeks. The maximum weight occurs
about 4 weeks after flowering in Kansas. This period is
determined largely by temperature and can extend up to
12 weeks in areas where the weather is cool.
Grain development stages are determined by the
hardness or consistency of the endosperm of the new
kernel. At the first stage, the endosperm has the color and
consistency of milk. As the kernel fills, the endosperm
thickens into a soft dough stage and finally a hard dough
stage. The doughy property of Kansas winter wheat can
be observed easily by chewing the kernel. Physiological
maturity occurs when the kernel has accumulated its
highest content of dry matter, has hardened, and changed
color. The kernel contains 30 to 35 percent water at
physiological maturity.
Protein and starch are the most important
constituents of the wheat kernel. Most of the protein
comes from nitrogen previously accumulated in the
leaves, and most of the starch is from sugars made by
photosynthesis during the grain-filling period. The
nitrogen moves into the filling kernels to form protein
during early grain development. This is why, if yields are
low because the kernels do not fill properly, the grain is
high in protein. Drought and high temperatures are
usually responsible for this condition. If the grain fills
normally and yields and test weights are high, grain
protein is frequently lower because it is diluted by other
materials. Of course, under good growing conditions,
grain protein can be increased with nitrogen fertilizer.
Most of the leaves senesce, or die, soon after
flowering, but the flag leaf, glumes, and awns remain
active during most of the grain-filling period.
Photosynthesis in the awns, or beard, provides 10 to 20
percent of the grain weight. This is why nearly all the
wheat varieties grown in Kansas have awns. In cooler
areas with higher rainfall, wheat leaves remain active
longer, and awns are less important.
The final yield component, kernel weight, is
determined during maturation. Yields are high when
favorable filling conditions, mild temperatures, and
active leaves promote growth of large, plump kernels.
High temperatures, especially when accompanied by
winds, and foliar diseases such as leaf rust cause
shriveled kernels, low test weights, and low yields.
Ripening includes the changes that occur after the
grain reaches physiological maturity. The most important
change is the loss of moisture from 30 to 35 percent in
mature grain to 12 to 13 percent in combine-ripe grain.
Grain must be harvested promptly after ripening to
save the yield. Hail, lodging, and preharvest sprouting
are ever-present threats to ripe grain.
Growth Stages and Management
Nitrogen fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation must be
applied to wheat at certain times to have the most effect.
Proper timing for most operations is determined by the
growth stage, not by the calendar date. Because growth at
any given date can vary from one year to the next, it is
important to be able to recognize the different growth
stages of wheat.
Two systems, the Feekes’ and the Zadoks’ scales, are
used for growth stages of wheat. The Feekes’ scale goes
from 1 for the first seedling leaf through 11.4 for mature
plants with hard grain. The Zadoks’ scale starts with 01
for seed germination and goes to 92 for hard grain and 99
for loss of dormancy by this grain. The wheat production
calendar on pages 4 and 5 gives the Feekes’ scale for
wheat growth stages, the dates when they usually occur
in Kansas, and important management operations that
should be done at each stage.
When Wheat Does Not Grow
A wheat plant is exposed to many hazards during its
lifetime. Low temperatures, high temperatures, drought,
hail, and wind will be mentioned here. Damage from
these occurs in adverse environments such as Kansas.
Losses can be decreased by developing more adaptable
varieties and using proper management but can never be
eliminated entirely.
7
Low temperatures injure wheat by winterkilling, by
early spring freezes that kill the growing point, and by
late spring freezes that cause sterility of the heads.
Winterkilling can be caused by direct freezing, ice sheets,
and desiccation. Hardier wheat varieties and possibly
milder winters have made winterkilling less of a problem
than it used to be. Improved management also has
helped. Timely seeding, good seedbed preparation, and
careful fall pasturing to leave plants vigorous and capable
of holding snow during low temperatures are good
management practices. Spring freezes seem to have
become important in recent years. Newer wheat varieties
that mature earlier, initiate spring growth earlier. When
spring growth starts, winter wheat rapidly loses hardiness
and is damaged easily by low temperatures.
High-temperature damage is most apparent during
grain filling when the kernels are shriveled and
prematurely ripe. It also can occur during fall and cause
poor tillering and hardening. During winter, high
temperatures can stimulate wheat to grow so that it will
be injured by subsequent low temperatures. Earlymaturing varieties have decreased high-temperature
losses. Because high-temperature stress and moisture
stress usually occur together, irrigation and moistureconserving practices can decrease losses.
The wheat plant combines drought escape and drought
resistance to overcome moisture stress. Most of its growth
occurs during fall and early spring, which are periods of
highest rainfall. Wheat is harvested before the dry summer
months and, in that way, escapes drought. Nevertheless, low
moisture and high temperature are considered limiting
factors for wheat production in Kansas.
Its extensive root system enables the wheat plant to
obtain moisture from deep in the soil. In low-rainfall
areas, soil moisture is depleted by continuous cropping
but is replenished by fallowing. The wheat plant also
adjusts to low-moisture conditions by forming fewer
tillers; producing less foliage; and decreasing
transpiration, the loss of water from the leaves.
Extent of hail damage to wheat depends on the
severity of the hail, the growth stage when it occurs, and
the variety. Hail before the boot stage injures wheat in
proportion to the amount of foliage removed. Wheat is
most susceptible to hail damage from the boot stage
through the milk stage. Florets on the wheat head in the
boot are injured easily by hail. Injury during early grain
development stages causes the grain to stop filling. At later
stages of grain development, hail shatters the kernels from
the head. Stems injured by hail often are broken over or off
by winds or further damaged by diseases.
Wind injury to wheat usually is caused by blown soil
that accompanies the wind. Abrasion of the soil on the
leaves and desiccation of the leaves during and after the
wind cause leaf burning. Wind damage also is sometimes
attributed to static electricity, and wind without sand can
burn margins and tips of wheat leaves. Lodging, or
falling over of the wheat plant, is another form of wind
injury. Lodging is most common after heading and when
growth has been overstimulated by excess nitrogen
fertilizer or moisture, high temperatures, or overplanting.
Preharvest sprouting of ripened grain occurs
occasionally in eastern and central Kansas when harvest is
delayed by wet conditions. Frequent rains, high humidity,
and heavy dews cause kernels in the spike to absorb
moisture and start germinating. Severe sprouting reduces
the test weight and breadmaking quality of the grain.
Fortunately, the Kansas climate, resistant varieties, and
timely harvest make preharvest sprouting a rare problem.
As wheat yields have increased, roughly half that
increase has been due to improved varieties with the
remaining half due to improved management. With
environmental conditions so unpredictable and variable,
proper variety selection can make the difference between
profit and loss in many years, so it deserves careful
attention each year. Obviously, the primary objective is to
pick varieties that will give high per-acre yields and the
highest possible net income, but this is not a simple matter.
Importance of Yield
Varieties do differ in grain yield potential. During
the past 20 years, yields have increased approximately
one-half bushel per acre per year, due to the release of
new improved varieties. Consider choosing new released
varieties on a regular basis, perhaps every 3 to 4 years, to
take advantage of the higher yield potential of new
varieties.
High yield potential should not be the only yardstick
for varietal selection and probably is not the most
important criterion since many factors influence actual
yield in the bin. Generally, for the top five or six
recommended varieties, all will have very good yield
potential. The key is to try to match the varieties’
strengths and minimize weaknesses so a variety has the
opportunity to yield well. Variety strengths (e.g. yield
potential, pest resistance, or strong straw) should be
matched against expected field problems (e.g. soilborne
mosaic, Hessian fly infestation, or lodging). Since no
perfect varieties have been developed, this usually results
Varieties
8
in compromise and assumption of risks in order to gain
advantages in other areas. Several different varieties
should be planted in order to hedge against some of the
unpredictable weather and pest problems.
The Numbers Problem
A complicating factor in recent years is the growing
number of choices. It takes more time now to sift through
characteristics, comparative performance data, seed
sources, and relative prices than it did a few years ago.
The Federal Plant Variety Protection Act stimulated
private breeding and sales of variety seed by providing a
plant patent protection to originators. Hybrids have their
own built-in patent protection because new seed must be
purchased for planting each year. In addition, Great
Plains public breeding programs have been active in
releasing new varieties in recent years.
Since it is not feasible for growers to individually
test all varieties on their farm, they must rely on other
sources for their information. Sources include their own
neighborhood experience, county agent demonstrations
and tours, Experiment Station field days and test
information, seed company demonstrations, advertising,
and meetings. It takes considerable effort, careful study,
and good judgment to make intelligent choices from all
of this information. Use your own experience with the
varieties you have personally grown as a base for
comparisons.
Kansas State University
Experiment Station Help
The Experiment Station role has changed over the
years. Varieties are not specifically recommended or
endorsed by the experiment station. Instead, varieties are
compared in scientifically conducted performance tests at
16 sites over Kansas each year, and the results are
distributed to the public soon after harvest (Kansas
Performance Tests with Winter Wheat Varieties). In
addition, many greenhouse and laboratory tests
contribute information on pest tolerance, baking quality,
and other factors. Publications summarizing the above
tests are available to growers at all county Extension
offices. Several of the more important publications that
are updated annually and available both in hard copy and
electronically include: Milling and Baking Qualities of
Hard Winter Wheat Varieties, which rates varieties based
upon their end-use properties; Kansas Performance Tests
with Winter Wheat Varieties, which includes detailed
current-year data, summary yield data over 2, 3, and 4
years at all locations, public variety pedigrees, private
company entries and addresses, and ratings for
agronomic traits, disease and insect resistance, and
bread-baking characteristics. Wheat Variety Disease and
Insect Ratings provides the most recent ratings for new
and established varieties and hybrids for resistance or
susceptibility to common insects and diseases attacking
wheat in Kansas.
Excellent current information is also available from
private publications. It is advisable to obtain as much
information as possible before deciding on a variety to
plant. Start with your production problems first; think
about what problems reduced yield potential over the
past 5 years, very likely there will be more than one. Try
to identify varieties that have strong ratings for tolerance
or resistance to these problems. From that list, consider
where the varieties you have chosen are best adapted.
Determine if the group of varieties has been tested for
milling and baking quality and try to choose the varieties
with above average ratings. Finally, from this group, pick
the top 3 or 4 varieties based on yield in performance
tests over a 2 to 3 year period. Avoid relying on data from
few locations or only 1 year of testing. These data, no
matter how reliable a specific test may be, can be
extremely misleading.
Variety Complementation
Each variety as discussed above will have specific
strengths and weaknesses, therefore it is recommended
that 3 or 4 varieties be considered as the optimum for
planting on the average wheat farm in Kansas. Because
pest problems change and the growing environments are
unpredictable it is dangerous to plant only 1 or 2
varieties. In choosing varieties consider the pedigree of
the variety and how similar they are to each other.
Planting both Karl and Karl 92 for example would give
you little diversity in variety selection because they are
very similar varieties. Choose varieties that have
different pedigrees and different growing patterns.
Important Characteristics to Consider
Maturity
Early maturing varieties are more likely to escape
damage from hot winds, drought, and rust. They are more
subject to late spring freezes, however. Producers with a
large number of acres can spread harvest by using
varieties of differing maturity. Varieties or hybrids that
flower earlier than Jagger or later than Arapahoe may run
into production difficulties in Kansas from frost damage
to heads and late-season hot winds, respectively.
Winter Hardiness
Wheat is most subject to damage from cold
temperatures in the fall before wheat hardens and in the
spring after growth starts. Varieties do differ in their
susceptibility to freeze damage. Rating for
winterhardiness are based on a scale of 1 (highest) to 9
(worst). Variety complementation is important for this
trait. If you have decided to plant a variety that is rated
average or poor for winterhardiness, you should select a
complementary second variety with more emphasis on
higher levels of winterhardiness.

Disease and Insect Resistance
Genetic resistance to insects and diseases is an
excellent control method when such resistance is available.
Hessian fly, wheat streak mosaic, soilborne mosaic, stem
and leaf rusts, speckled leaf blotch, tan spot, and other
diseases can and do cause serious losses in the Kansas
wheat crop. Use of resistant or tolerant varieties, plus good
cultural practices, can minimize losses.
Lodging and Shattering
Since wheat is harvested with the combine and
harvesting must wait until the crop is ripe, varieties that
do not lodge or shatter are desired. The shorter
“semidwarf” wheats usually stand better than standard
height varieties. Under dry conditions where deep
planting is necessary, the short coleoptiles (sprouts) of
some of the semidwarfs may cause a problem in
obtaining good stands.
Grain Quality
The major use of Kansas wheat is bread wheat for
human consumption. Therefore, it is important that the
grain be of a quality needed by the millers and bakers to
produce a quality end product. Quality is determined by
variety as well as by growing conditions. Since quality is
important, it is essential that producers consider quality
in selecting varieties to grow.
Acid Tolerance
Many soils in Kansas are becoming more acidic due
to the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Acidic (low pH) soils
have more free aluminum, which can burn root tips and
lead to poor vigor. As a wheat producer you should be
aware of the pH of your soil. Wheat varieties do differ in
their ability to tolerate low pH soils.
Coleoptile Length
Many newer semidwarf varieties have short
coleoptiles that cannot emerge from deep planting.
Rating for coleoptile length are based upon the standard
check variety Larned. Producers should be attentive of
seed planting depth if they are planting varieties with
coleoptile lengths less than 3 inches.
Grazing Potential
Many Kansas wheat growers gain extra income by
grazing livestock on wheat fields in the fall, winter or
early spring. There are differences among varieties in the
amount of forage produced. Producers should be careful
in selecting wheat varieties for grazing without sound
data. Although most current varieties are rated for their
grazing potential, many newly released varieties have not
been evaluated because the grazing or clipping tests are
difficult and expensive. Awnless varieties can be grazed
after heading in the spring because there is reduced
danger of awns injuring livestock.
Seed Quality
Utilizing good quality wheat seed for planting is the
foundation for obtaining excellent germination and stand
establishment. Good quality seed is true to variety, free
of other crop seeds, weeds, foreign material, disease, and
has plump, dense kernels of high germination. Seed
quality is one of many factors that affects forage
production and grain yield and can be very important
when planting in poor conditions, such as dry soils, deep
planting, or late planting. Growers may influence forage
and grain yields with decisions relating to quality of seed
that is to be planted.
Large, dense kernels are considered to be of better
quality than low test weight kernels. Large seed tends to
tiller more than small seed. However, small, dense
kernels are better than large, light kernels. In the seedcleaning process a gravity table will remove the light
seed. After seed size, another factor related to seed
quality is the protein content of the seed. The amount of
protein, not protein percentage, in the seed is very
important to early seedling vigor. Large seed may have a
lower protein percentage than small, shriveled seed, but
because it is larger it will have more total protein per
seed. Test weight of the grain is often used as a measure
of seed quality, but test weight is a bulk density or a
weight per volume measurement and small seed that
packs well can have a high test weight. If producers use
test weight as a seed quality measurement they should
use seed with test weights above 57 pounds per bushel.
Actually, a high thousand kernel weight (TKW) is a
better measure of seed quality. A 30 gram TKW, which
translates to 15,200 seeds per pound is an appropriate
minimum TKW for a seedlot. There are a few varieties
grown in Kansas that have small seed with a lower TKW,
but their seed is still suitable for planting. With these
varieties, producers should utilize the largest seed they
can obtain.
Seed cleaning and sizing is essential to remove
straw, chaff, dirt stones, weed seeds, and broken,
diseased or small shriveled kernels. Generally, seed
cleaning will add 1 to 2 pounds to the seedlot’s test
weight by removing the small kernels. Taking a
germination test is essential to determine the seed
viability. After seed germinability has been determined,
the seeding rate can be determined. Seed to be used for
planting should be above 85 percent germination.
Planting Practices
10
Another reason for seed cleaning is the fact that
semidwarf varieties tend to have more seed size
variability. This has resulted in higher clean-out
percentages. Although the clean-out fraction (small and
shriveled kernels) contains seed that will germinate, this
seed may germinate and emerge slower and less
uniformly and produce weaker seedlings with fewer
tillers than larger kernels.
Unfortunately, a few producers still use combine-run
or bin-run grain as a seed source to be planted. Seed as
received by a combine is seldom in condition for
planting. Planting combine-run or bin-run seed allows a
problem weed species to spread, since it is replanted with
the uncleaned wheat seed.
Using certified seed is an excellent way to ensure the
quality of a seedlot. All certified seed has been cleaned
and is labeled according to seed law indicating variety,
percent germination and date tested, percent pure seed,
and percent inert material. The official minimum test
weight for certified seed is 56 pounds per bushel.
Certified seed is the grower’s best assurance of
purchasing excellent quality seed. Seed is a very low-cost
item in the total production costs. High quality seed
usually does not cost as much in the long run as bargain
seed or low-priced seedlots. Poor quality seed can be
expensive in terms of poor stand establishment resulting
in yield losses and future problems with weeds and
diseases.
Producers ask how often they should buy new seed.
They are worried the varieties they are using will “revert
back” or not remain pure. Wheat is a self-pollinated crop,
so varieties remain true to type. But some crosspollination or outcrossing can and does occur, especially
when freezing or very cool temperatures occur at heading
or flowering. When outcrossing occurs and that seed is
used for planting, the subsequent plants may differ
greatly in height and appearance from the original plants.
Seed contamination with other varieties is another factor
causing the wheat to look ragged with off-type plants. As
most producers plant three or more varieties each year,
they will purchase certified seed of one of their varieties
each year. This will minimize the effect of outcrossing or
contamination. With hybrid wheats becoming more
prevalent producers will need to buy new seed each year.
Planting saved seed of hybrid wheat will result in yield
losses of 5 to 15 percent the following year.
Seeding Date
Climatic conditions vary greatly across Kansas
causing the recommended planting dates to vary for
different areas. Producers try to plant wheat at a time so
seedlings have well established crown roots and three to
five tillers before winter dormancy, thereby enabling the
plants to minimize winterkill damage. Planting within a
week of the Hessian fly-free date for an area will usually
allow enough time for adequate fall growth. Planting too
early increases the hazards of insects and diseases, such
as Hessian fly, leaf rust and wheat streak mosaic virus.
But in areas where wheat is grazed, producers will plant
2 to 3 weeks earlier than they would if the wheat is to be
used for grain to ensure fall growth for grazing.
In some areas of western Kansas, where available
soil moisture is always a concern, planting too early can
cause excessive fall growth and soil moisture depletion
for early spring growth, but this is not a problem for
much of the state. Planting later than optimum often
causes limited fall growth, both root and tiller formation
and subjects the wheat to wind damage and increased
potential for winterkill damage. But producers may need
to plant later when late rains allow grassy weeds, like
cheat or downy brome to germinate and need to be
destroyed by tillage. Also, in areas where wheat is
double-cropped after row crops, wheat will be planted
later than optimum.

Zone 4.............October 5-October 25
Seeding Rate
Seeding rates vary across Kansas like seeding dates
because of environmental conditions. Due to the lower
rainfall in western Kansas, generally, the seeding rates
are lower than in central and eastern Kansas. But in
western Kansas seeding rates have increased slightly
during the past decade. Seeding rates in western Kansas
range from 600,000 to 900,000 seeds per acre planted (40
to 60 pounds per acre at a rate of 15,000 seeds per
pound). Considering 80 percent germination and
emergence, the plant population may vary from 450,000
to 750,000 plants per acre.
With lower seeding rates the plants will tiller more
than with higher seeding rates. A hard rain soon after
planting may cause crusting and result in poor emergence
and stands. Producers need to determine the plant
populations before they decide to replant. In most areas,
11
stands can be reduced by 50 to 60 percent with only a
small effect on grain yield. Producers may have areas
within the field that require spot replanting to prevent
wind erosion or weed problems.
In central Kansas, the seeding rates range from
750,000 to 900,000 seeds per acre (50 to 60 pounds per
acre at a rate of 15,000 seeds per pound). Final stands
should be 600,000 to 720,000 plants per acre. In eastern
Kansas, the seeding rates range from 900,000 to
1,125,000 seeds per acre (60 to 75 pounds per acre at a
rate of 15,000 seeds per pound) with final stands of
720,000 to 900,000 plants per acre. With irrigation,
seeding rates may range from 900,000 to 1,350,000 seeds
per acre (60 to 90 pounds per acre at a rate of 15,000
seeds per pound) and final stands of 720,000 to
1,080,000 plants per acre. Seeding rates can be adjusted
upward by 10 to 20 percent if conditions are good or
producers desire quicker ground cover. As planting date
is delayed the seeding rate should be increased to
compensate for the lack of tillering associated with
delayed planting. With wheat double-cropping after row
crops or planting wheat to graze, the seeding rate should
be increased by 50 to 100 percent. Also, seeding rates
should be increased 10 to 15 percent when using very
large seed to compensate for fewer seeds per pound.
Wheat can emerge from various depths, but a
planting depth of 1 to 2 inches is optimal. In drier areas, a
hoe drill can place the seed deeper into moisture. With
deeper plantings producers should be aware of the
coleoptile length of the variety to be planted and should
use varieties with long coleoptiles.

Seedbed Preparation
Seedbed preparation varies across the state
depending on residue of the preceding crop, the need for
moisture conservation, and the producer’s attitude toward
tillage. The amount of tillage for seedbed preparation has
been reduced during the past decade. Plowing, which was
prevalent during the 1970s and 1980s is practiced only
on a limited basis in the continuous wheat areas of south
central Kansas. Producers should strive for a firm
seedbed, which promotes good seed to soil contact and
results in rapid germination and stand establishment, at
the lowest possible cost. Frequently, producers will till in
an attempt to cover all their acres when the soils are too
wet for tillage equipment. This contributes to compaction
and tillage pans which can cause problems later in the
growing season.
In the continuous wheat areas of the state, residue
management is difficult. Most producers use 1 or 2
diskings or a chisel operation to incorporate residues.
This is followed by another disking or a field cultivator
as planting time approaches. With more residues
remaining on the soil surface, foliar diseases, such as tan
spot and Septoria leaf blotch, have increased. Resistant
varieties are important in this cropping system. On the
heavier, sloping soils of eastern Kansas, soil erosion by
water is a major concern. Terraces, waterways, and crop
residue management are required on many highly
erodible acres. Where crop rotations are utilized, the row
crop residue after harvest is left untouched until late
summer when 1 or 2 diskings or field cultivations are
used before wheat seeding. Many producers have saved
time and soil moisture by planting no-till wheat doublecropped after harvest. Most drills are able to no-till into
soybean and sunflower residue in a wheat doublecropping situation. No-till drills are effective for planting
into corn and sorghum residues. If the row crop is corn,
some tillage may be performed to destroy the residue,
which lowers the incidence of scab.
Traditionally, in western Kansas where moisture
conservation is the most important goal, the wheat-fallow
system has been dominant. In this system, a wheat crop is
produced every 2 years. Summer fallowing allows soil
moisture to buildup while the land is idle from one harvest
through the next summer until wheat seeding in the fall.
Unfortunately, the wheat-fallow system has a very low
water-use efficiency. Tillage operations to control weeds
cause soil moisture loss. As little as 0.25 inches of rain on
bare soil can seal the soil and cause rain water to runoff.
However, if residues are left on the soil by utilizing
conservation tillage methods, soil moisture will be
replenished sooner so that a summer crop (corn, grain
sorghum, sunflower, or millet) can be planted to utilize the
stored moisture. This wheat-summer crop-fallow system
produces two crops in 3 years and has been shown to be
more profitable than the wheat-fallow system.
Residues reduce evaporation, soil erosion, and runoff,
and increase water infiltration and snow catch during the
winter. After wheat harvest in the summer, a residual
triazine herbicide replaces several tillage operations to
12
control summer weed growth. To maximize moisture
savings, the wheat residue is left undisturbed until the
summer crop is planted no-till into the stubble. After the
summer crop harvest the residue is left untouched until the
following fall when wheat can be planted no-till or if there
is ample moisture in the soil profile in the spring producers
may opt to plant a summer crop again.
Residue Management
Residue management, through conservation tillage,
is an effective tool for reducing soil erosion. The
percentage of the soil surface covered with residue is
important in determining how much erosion will occur
from rainfall runoff. Crop residue shields the soil surface
from the rainfall impact, thus reducing the amount of
particle detachment. Residue also reduces the amount of
crusting, which allows more water to soak into the soil,
and creates numerous small dams, which reduce runoff
velocities and the capacity to carry sediment. Standing
residue increases snow catch in the winter and increases
moisture storage for the subsequent crop.
In Kansas, the highest erosive rainfall energies occur
in late May and June when the growing wheat generally
provides adequate cover to protect against soil erosion.
The potential for significant water erosion exists after
harvest, because of the intense nature of thunderstorms
typical of Kansas summers, and in the fall, when little
residue may remain as a result of cultural practices.
Wind erosion is a serious problem in Kansas,
particularly in late winter and early spring. Wind erosion
is especially troublesome with wheat, because inadequate
residue or growing cover exists during the critical period.
Crop residue serves to reduce wind erosion by reducing
the velocity of wind that contacts the soil surface by
creating small, calm air pockets that allow airborne
particles to fall back to the surface. Standing residue is
more effective than flat residue in controlling wind
erosion.
Research from neighboring states shows a 50 percent
reduction in soil erosion on fields with 20 to 30 percent
residue cover as compared to cleanly tilled fields. No-till
planting reduced soil erosion by 90 to 95 percent. A 30
percent surface residue cover for water erosion control or
1,000 pounds of flat, small grain residue or its equivalent
for wind erosion control after planting is usually
adequate in Kansas. The actual level of residue required
in your fields may vary above or below these limits.
Local Natural Resources Conservation Service personnel
can provide assistance in determining residue needs.
Adequate nutrients at each stage of development are
essential for maximum economic yields of wheat.
Nitrogen removal per bushel by wheat compared to corn
and grain sorghum is slightly higher due to the higher
protein content of wheat. Removal per bushel of other
nutrients is very similar to corn and grain sorghum.
In general, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are
the primary nutrient needs. Most Kansas soils supply
adequate amounts of the secondary and micronutrients.
Climatic and cultural systems must be taken into account
when developing a fertilization program.
Determining Nutrient Need
Nutrient need can be determined by several methods,
including soil tests, field trials, nutrient removal, plant
analysis, past experience, or a combination of these.
Probably the most reliable means of determining lime
and nutrient need is by soil testing regularly with support
from the other methods listed. Remember a soil test is no
better than the sample collected in the field.
Soil test interpretations are based on many years of
research work conducted across the state and reliable
interpretations can be made for the likelihood of
obtaining a response provided yield potential is not
restricted by other factors.
Lime
Liming should not be overlooked as wheat will
respond to lime. Lime needs can be accurately
determined by soil tests. The greatest need for lime is in
the eastern two-thirds of Kansas. Very low pH soils have
been found in south central Kansas and marked responses
to lime application by wheat have been found.
Nitrogen
Nitrogen is the element most frequently lacking for
optimum wheat production. Nitrogen recommendations
are based on expected yield, cropping system, soil
texture, and available profile nitrogen.

A soil test for available profile nitrogen is very
helpful in evaluating the amount of residual nitrogen. The
test measures the quantity of available nitrogen in the soil
at the time the sample is collected. The soil sample for
the available nitrogen test should be taken after July 1 for
preplant and after November 1 for topdress applications.
The results from this profile test are interpreted for
adjusting nitrogen recommendations to utilize
accumulated available nitrogen found in the soil profile.
Accumulations of available nitrogen are most likely to
occur in fields receiving high nitrogen additions from
either fertilizer or manure or having very poor yields
because of drought, hail or other natural disasters.
Accumulation of available nitrogen also may occur under
summer fallow conditions because of the extended time
for nitrification between crops. Because nitrates are mobile
and move with soil moisture, sampling to a depth of 2 feet,
when possible, is advised for this test and the
interpretation of the test results is based on a 2-foot profile.
Another important consideration in determining the
optimum nitrogen fertilizer rate is cropping sequence.
Research in Kansas and adjoining states shows nitrogen
credits for legumes grown in rotations can be substantial.
Table 2 summarizes nitrogen credits for legumes. In
contrast to row crops, no credit is given for wheat
following soybeans because nitrogen needs for wheat
come early in the spring before the nitrogen in the
soybean residue is mineralized.

Summer preplant and spring topdressing are the
recommended times of nitrogen application for fall
seeded small grains in Kansas. Preplant applications of
nitrogen should be incorporated into the soil by tillage or
injected directly into the soil. Applying nitrogen prior to
seeding has several advantages among which are:
• eliminations of one planting time operation by
incorporating fertilizer application into a tillage
operation,
• deeper placement of the nitrogen to avoid poor
utilization from dry surface soil conditions, and
• shifting the work load into a slack period.
Spring applications on the other hand have the
advantage of better knowledge of moisture situation and
crop condition prior to expenditure of money for nitrogen
and a shorter period of capital tie-up prior to harvest. On
sandy soils susceptible to leaching and on clayey soils
subject to standing water, only a small amount of the
total nitrogen should be applied in the fall. The rest of the
nitrogen should be applied as a spring topdressing to
minimize nitrogen loss through leaching or volatilization.
Nitrogen can be applied at seeding in small
quantities for starter effect, but no more than 20 pounds
of nitrogen plus potash (K2
O) per acre should be placed
in direct contact with the seed. Germination injury is
more severe in seasons of poor moisture.
Applying anhydrous ammonia with tillage
implements is an excellent method of application.
Applying nitrogen with undercutter blades and field
cultivators is effective and thus offers an additional way
to cut costs by combining tillage and fertilizer operations.
Nitrogen recommendations can be calculated by
using these factors:
N Rec (lbs/a) = [YG × 1.75] STA – PCA – PYM – PNST
where,
N Rec = nitrogen recommended in pounds per acre
YG = a realistic yield goal in bushels per acre
STA = soil texture adjustment (1.1 for sandy soils
and 1.0 for medium and fine textures)

Spring applications of nitrogen should be completed
by jointing, which normally occurs in early to mid-March.
Later applications of nitrogen may increase protein content
of the grain, but have less effect on yield. Spring applied
nitrogen in general has increased grain protein content
more than fall applied nitrogen.
Selection of a nitrogen fertilizer should be made on
the basis of cost, availability, and ease of application. In
calculating cost of specific materials, don’t forget to
include application costs. Research in Kansas has shown
all nitrogen carriers to be essentially equal in supplying
nitrogen for small grains when properly applied.
In years of heavy straw production, an additional 20
pounds of nitrogen per ton of incorporated straw should be
considered to help decompose the straw, realizing
additional residual nitrogen may be available for
succeeding crops.
Fertilizing for Protein
In recent years, the average grain protein in Kansas
wheat has been slightly over 11 percent, which is below
the optimum for domestic flour production. This low
protein content has been the result of several factors
including a decline in available soil nitrogen.
Nitrogen fertilization for ensuring high protein in
wheat requires nitrogen rates in excess of those for
optimum grain production. Farmers undertaking a
fertilization program for high protein must combine the
practice with a marketing program to receive a protein
premium to pay for the additional nitrogen. Additional
nitrogen applied as a topdress above the recommended rate
will favor higher protein. However, many climatic and
genetic factors also are involved. Excess nitrogen applied
early in the season can lead to lodging problems or excess
nitrate leaching in some areas and should be approached
with caution on fields with a history of lodging.
Phosphorus
Wheat is known to respond well to applications of
phosphorus on soils testing low or very low in available
phosphorus. Wheat plants do not tiller well under severe
phosphorus deficiency and often are more subject to
winterkill.
Phosphorus for small grains should be applied
broadcast incorporated, injected in concentrated bands
preplant, or banded at planting. Band applications of this
plant nutrient with the seed at planting or injected preplant
are recognized as being generally more efficient than
broadcast treatments, particularly when low rates are
applied on acid soils low in available phosphorus. The
efficiency of broadcast applications, regardless of soil pH
and available soil phosphorus content, can be improved
by incorporating the phosphorus fertilizer into the soil.
This allows the plant to continue to use phosphorus even
when the surface is dry.
Another alternative would be to band apply both
nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer before planting. Dual
application of N and P with a tillage implement has the
advantages of saving time by combining fertilization
with tillage and of placing the phosphorus in the root
zone for good utilization.
Liquids and solids as well as varying chemical forms
of phosphorus (ortho- and poly-phosphates) are available
on the market. Research conducted by Kansas State
University researchers has shown that all are
agronomically equal when applied at the same phosphate
rate and by the same method of application. Selection of a
phosphorus source, therefore, should be made on the basis
of cost, availability and adaptability to your operations.
Potassium
Like for phosphorus, a soil test is your best guide to
potassium need. Soils low in potassium are most likely to
be found in southeastern Kansas or sandy soils in other
areas of the state.
Potassium may either be applied as a planting time
starter or broadcast and incorporated ahead of planting.
These two methods should provide equal results.
Applications of potassium in direct contact with the seed
should be limited to avoid possible germination damage. If
nitrogen also is to be placed with the seed, limit the total
amount of nitrogen plus potash (K2
O) to 20 pounds per acre.
The most common potassium source is muriate of
potash (potassium chloride); however, potassium sulfate,
potassium nitrate, potassium-magnesium sulfate and
mixed fertilizers are other sources of potassium. Little
difference exists between materials in potassium
availability. Selection should be based on cost, availability,
and adaptability to the overall farm operation.
Other Nutrients
Sulfur deficiency may occur on sandy, low organic
matter soils. Research has not shown a consistent
response to sulfur on other soils, but with good yield
potential, sulfur application test strips might be tried.
Yield increases to chloride application have been
found with the most consistent increases coming in the

Major Problems and Losses
from Weeds in Wheat
Weeds reduce wheat yields and profits by competing
with the crop for moisture, light, space, and nutrients.
Weeds also interfere with harvest and result in dockage
and lower quality grain, which adds to the total economic
impact of weeds in wheat. According to a report by the
Weed Science Society of America, weeds were estimated
to cause over $50 million annual loss in production of
Kansas wheat.
Yield losses and harvest problems caused by weeds
in wheat varies depending on the weed species, weed
population, time of weed emergence, growing conditions,
and status of the wheat crop. A healthy stand of winter
wheat that has a head start on weeds is very competitive
and will suppress weed growth and interference.
However, a thin stand of wheat that is stressed due to
disease, insects, nutrient deficiency, or drought is not
very competitive with weeds. A few scattered large
weeds may cause significant problems in some wheat
fields, while a high population of small, late germinating
weeds may have little impact in other wheat fields.
Time of weed emergence relative to crop emergence
has a tremendous influence on competition and yield
reduction caused by weeds. Weeds that emerge with the
wheat crop or early in the season are more competitive
with wheat than weeds that emerge later in the season.
Thus, winter annual weeds generally cause more yield
reductions in winter wheat than do summer annual weeds.
Winter annual weeds generally germinate and
emerge in the fall about the time wheat is planted, and
produce seed in the spring when wheat matures.
Germination depends on soil temperatures and
precipitation. Winter annual weeds also may germinate
and emerge during the winter or spring, but generally are
not as competitive with the wheat as fall germinating
weeds. Henbit, field pennycress, flixweed, mustards,
jointed goatgrass, and cheatgrass (cheat, Japanese brome,
and downy brome) are examples of important winter
annual weeds that may infest winter wheat.
Winter annual broadleaf weeds such as flixweed,
tansy mustard, field pennycress, and bushy wallflower
are some of the most common weeds in winter wheat.
They are prolific seed producers and may be present at
high populations. Most winter annual broadleaf weeds
can be easily controlled in wheat with herbicides, but can
cause significant yield reductions if left uncontrolled. In
Weed Management
There is little indication that nutrients other than those
mentioned above are deficient for wheat in Kansas.
Calcium and magnesium are relatively abundant in the
majority of Kansas soils. Liming of acid soils supplies
sufficient calcium and a deficiency of this element would
not be expected.
Research with other elements such as boron,
manganese, iron, copper and zinc has not revealed any
consistent responses and these elements should not be a
problem for optimum wheat yields. Percent Yield Reduction

research at Manhattan, Kansas, a high population of
bushy wallflower caused a 25 percent reduction in wheat
yields from season long competition (Figure 3). Wheat
yield reductions from bushy wallflower competition
increased as treatment time was delayed. Timely weed
control is important to minimize early season weed
competition with the crop.
Winter annual grasses like cheatgrass and jointed
goatgrass are some of the most troublesome weeds in
wheat because of their competitiveness and difficulty to
control. Research at the Hays Experiment Station found
that 100 cheat or downy brome plants per square yard,
that emerged within one week of wheat emergence,
reduced wheat yields over 35 percent (Figure 4). Cheat
and downy brome at 100 plants per square yard, that
didn’t emerge until 3 to 4 weeks after the wheat, only
reduced wheat yields 12 and 6 percent, respectively. In
addition, cheatgrass and jointed goatgrass also cause
lodging, harvest difficulty, and dockage.
Summer annual weeds germinate in the spring and
complete their life cycle during the summer months.
Summer annual weeds often do not reduce wheat yields
as much as winter annual weeds, but may interfere with
harvest, especially in thin, stressed wheat stands. The
summer annual weeds that usually cause the greatest
problems in winter wheat are those that emerge early in
spring, such as wild buckwheat, kochia, Russian thistle,
and sunflower.
Perennial weeds generally are not as abundant as
annual weeds, but are more difficult to control. Perennial
weeds grow indefinitely over a period of years and
reproduce and spread both vegetatively and by seeds.
Many perennial weeds produce new stems from
extensive root systems that can be spread from one area
to another. Therefore, the roots of perennial weeds must
be killed or depleted of food reserves to achieve longterm control. Once established, perennial weeds are very
competitive and difficult to control.
Field bindweed and woollyleaf bursage are examples
of perennial weeds that may infest wheat. These weeds are
fairly tolerant to the herbicides and rates that can be
applied to the growing wheat crop, so the best time to
manage perennial weeds is between crops or during a
fallow period, especially in the fall. The most effective
control programs generally consist of multiple treatments
over several seasons. Established perennial weeds are
rarely eliminated with a single operation.
Preventive Weed Control
Preventive weed management is prudent and
economical. Introduction of new weeds into a clean field
can increase weed control costs for many years. Weeds
can be inadvertently introduced into clean fields with
contaminated wheat seed, tillage and harvest equipment,
manure applications, animals, wind, and water. Some of
these factors cannot be controlled, while others can.
Plant only wheat seed that is free of weed seeds.
Clean seed to be used for wheat planting, or purchase
certified wheat seed that has been inspected and cleaned.
Certified wheat seed cannot contain any prohibited
noxious weed seed and must have the percentage of other
weed seed contaminants listed on the label.
Clean equipment and combines when moving
between infested fields. Field bindweed root segments
can easily be transported within fields or between fields
on field cultivators and other tillage implements.
Combines are excellent at collecting weed seed and
dispersing them at later times. Ask custom harvesters
about previous jobs and inspect combines before entering
fields. If possible, harvest the clean fields or parts of
fields before harvesting weedy areas.
The only way to effectively control some potential
weed problems is by hand removal when a few scattered
weeds are first observed. Hand removal of a few
scattered plants, such as volunteer rye, may be warranted
to prevent having a more serious problem in future years.
Cultural Weed Control
Cultural practices can have a profound effect on
weed problems. Production practices that encourage
quick emergence and vigorous wheat growth will provide
the crop with a competitive advantage over many weeds.
Preparation of a firm seedbed, using high quality seed,
fertility management, and proper seed placement can
help establish a good healthy wheat crop.
The most serious weeds in a crop are those that
resemble the crop and respond similarly to environmental
and production practices. The winter annual grasses,

including cheatgrass, jointed goatgrass, and volunteer
rye, are some of the more serious weed problems in
winter wheat. Cultural practices are essential to manage
winter annual grass problems.
Crop rotation is probably the best way to manage
these weeds. Rotation to a summer crop helps break the
life cycle of these weeds and allows the use of tillage or
herbicides during the fall or spring to prevent seed
production and deplete seed reserves in the soil.
However, crop rotation without preventing weed seed
production will not help reduce weed populations.
Burning and moldboard plowing wheat stubble
have been shown to reduce populations of certain
weeds, like cheatgrass, but may not be practical or
acceptable due to the risk of soil erosion. The
effectiveness of burning is variable and depends on the
position of the cheatgrass seed, and the duration and
temperature of the burn. Cheatgrass seed that is mixed
down into the soil will not be very susceptible to
burning, while cheatgrass seed that remains up off the
soil surface is susceptible. Weeds with a hard seedcoat
generally are not very susceptible to burning.
Plowing can reduce populations of certain weeds by
burying the seed deeper than it can emerge. Plowing is
fairly effective on cheatgrass problems because the seed
is fairly short-lived, and cannot emerge from more than 3
to 4 inches deep in the soil. However, plowing may
simply delay problems with other weeds, such as jointed
goatgrass, because the seed goes dormant when buried
deep in the soil. The seed remains dormant until brought
back up to the soil surface with tillage in future years.
Planting date also can be manipulated to reduce
populations of certain weeds. Winter annual weeds
generally will start to germinate early in the fall,
depending on soil temperatures and moisture. A delay in
wheat planting date until several flushes of winter annual
weeds have germinated and been destroyed with tillage
or herbicides decreases the total number of weeds
competing with the crop. However, delayed seeding may
decrease grazing and yield potential depending on
climatic conditions and planting complications.
Weed Control with Herbicides
Herbicides, if used properly, are a safe and effective
option for control of certain weeds in wheat. However,
herbicides will not solve all weed problems and should
be used only as needed in an integrated weed
management program. Several herbicides are approved
for use on wheat to control different weed species.
Important factors to consider when choosing a herbicide
include: 1) weed species present, 2) stage of crop and
weed development, 3) herbicide persistence and
recropping restrictions, 4) and risk of off-site movement.
Knowledge of weed problems in the field and proper
weed identification are necessary when choosing a
herbicide. Most herbicides selectively control certain
weed species as listed on the label. Weeds not listed on
the label probably will not be controlled.
Herbicides should only be applied at the stages of
application recommended on the label in order to achieve
the desired results. Wheat must be in the proper stage of
growth to avoid crop injury. Application too early or late
may result in stunting and wheat yield reductions. Wheat
generally is most tolerant to postemergence broadleaf
control herbicides when the wheat is fully tillered, but
prior to jointing. However, the proper wheat stage of
growth for application depends on the specific herbicide.
No herbicides are labelled for application when wheat is
in the early boot to soft dough stage. Application during
this time likely would result in sterility, poor grain fill,
and reduced yields.
Postemergence herbicides generally are most
effective when applied to small weeds that are actively
growing. Winter annual broadleaf weeds are most
susceptible when in the rosette stage of growth in the fall
or early spring. Winter annual weeds that have bolted and
produced the flowering stalk are more tolerant to
herbicides and already may have caused some damage to
the wheat.
Environmental conditions have a great influence on
the activity of most herbicides. Preplant incorporated and
preemergence herbicides generally need adequate
precipitation following application to be effective. Dry
weather following a preemergence application will not
activate the herbicide and probably will result in poor
weed control.
Most postemergence herbicides perform best with
favorable temperatures and moisture for active growth of
both wheat and weeds. Treatment with postemergence
herbicides when the wheat and weeds are dormant
generally is less effective, unless the herbicide also has
residual activity in the soil, like Glean, Amber, or
Finesse. Do not apply herbicides if the soil is frozen or
covered with snow.
Always consult the label and follow directions
concerning application rates, timing, spray additives,
application technique, and personal protection
equipment when using any pesticide. For more
information on specific herbicide use and weed control
ratings, refer to the annual KSU Report of Progress
titled Chemical Weed Control in Field Crops, Pastures,
Rangeland, and Noncropland available at your County
Extension Office or the KSU Extension Distribution
Center. The report of progress is revised annually and
provides more specific information on herbicide use in
wheat and other field crops.

Kansas wheat is subject to more than 30 different
diseases. Estimated statewide losses due to all diseases
combined are approximately 20 percent per year.
Individual fields may sustain losses of 50 percent or
more. In addition to yield loss, diseases frequently reduce
the test weight. Two diseases, ergot and scab, may
contaminate grain with mycotoxins. Therefore, diseases
affect both the yield and quality of the wheat crop.
It is not possible to completely control all wheat
diseases. Instead, concentrate on the most important
diseases likely to affect each field. Your local K-State
Research and Extension agent can help you determine
which diseases are most important in your area. Then use a
combination of disease management methods to minimize
economic losses. Following are the main components of
an integrated disease management program.
Scouting
Frequent field scouting is important for monitoring
crop development and identifying problems in the early
stages before they become severe. Correct diagnosis is
crucial because control measures are different for the
different diseases. Color pictures of common wheat
diseases can be found in K-State Research and Extension
publication S-84, Diagnosing Wheat Production
Problems in Kansas. See your local county K-State
Research and Extension agent for assistance in
diagnosing wheat diseases.
Resistant Varieties
Resistant varieties are often the most effective,
economical, and environmentally friendly method of
disease control. Resistance ratings are published each
year in K-State Research and Extension publication
MF-991, Wheat Variety Disease and Insect Ratings.
Resistance ratings are provided for wheat soilborne
mosaic, wheat spindle streak mosaic, wheat streak
mosaic, barley yellow dwarf, leaf rust, stem rust, Septoria
leaf blotch, glume blotch, tan spot, powdery mildew, and
Hessian fly. Resistance to the Russian wheat aphid and to
the greenbug is available in some varieties. Some
varieties, such as Karl 92, have partial resistance to scab.
Some varieties also have moderate resistance to
Stagonospora nodorum leaf blotch.
Planting several different varieties with different
strengths and weaknesses is a good disease management
strategy. It reduces the risk that any particular disease
will cause catastrophic losses. Diversification of variety
maturity also reduces risk of some diseases. The best
example is scab, which attacks only when rainy weather
coincides with flowering. Usually only certain varieties
are flowering when rain occurs, and the others escape
infection. Finally, early varieties may mature before late
season diseases like stem rust can become severe.
Crop Rotation
Crop rotation is a “best management practice”
because it reduces the carryover of diseases, insects, and
weeds between crops. It is very effective for controlling
tan spot, dryland root rot, eyespot, Cephalosporium
stripe, and take-all root rot. Crop rotation may reduce
severity of scab, seedling blight, Septoria leaf blotch,
Stagonospora leaf blotch, glume blotch, and sharp
eyespot. One year of rotation or fallow is enough to
break the cycle for most diseases.
A few pathogens can crossover between different
crops. The take-all fungus can build up on barley, smooth
brome, and weedy bromegrasses. The scab fungus builds
up on corn and survives in surface corn residue.
Therefore, avoid planting wheat after barley or brome, or
into heavy corn residue.
Crop Residue Destruction
Crop residue destruction can reduce the risk of
disease carryover following wheat, barley, brome, or corn
crops. Tan spot, Cephalosporium stripe, scab, and take-all
are diseases that may be reduced by crop residue
destruction. Several tillage passes may be required to
break up and bury most of the residue. This is expensive,
loses soil moisture, and may lead to soil erosion.
Fortunately, residue destruction is not needed if
planting into residue of soybeans, sorghum, alfalfa, rye,
oats, or sunflowers. Year-old wheat residue also is safe.
In recent years, increased emphasis on erosion
control and moisture conservation has made residue
destruction undesirable for most producers. Luckily,
increased freedom to rotate crops makes residue
destruction unnecessary.
Volunteer Wheat Control
Volunteer wheat can be a “green bridge” that allows
pests to survive the period between wheat crops.
Volunteer wheat can serve as a reservoir for wheat streak
mosaic, High Plains mosaic, barley yellow dwarf, leaf
rust, stem rust, and take-all root rot. It also harbors
Hessian fly, Russian wheat aphids, greenbugs, Banks
grass mites, and wheat curl mites. Therefore, destruction
of volunteer wheat is an important component of
integrated pest management.
 Since many of the pests on volunteer wheat are
migratory, volunteer wheat should be eliminated at least
1
/2 mile from wheat plantings. The objective is to break
Disease Management
19
the green bridge before the new crop emerges. Therefore,
volunteer should be eradicated at least 2 weeks before
planting to ensure a thorough kill. Sometimes a late flush
of volunteer occurs around planting time. This late flush
is not a risk factor if there was just previously a
volunteer-free period to break the green bridge.
Volunteer can be destroyed with either tillage or
herbicides. For further details, see Cooperative Extension
Service publication MF-1004, Be A Good Neighbor:
Control Your Volunteer Wheat.
Delayed Planting
Early planting is sometimes necessary for forage
production or erosion control. However, early planting is
also a risk factor for several diseases including wheat
streak mosaic, High Plains mosaic, barley yellow dwarf,
sharp eyespot, common root rot, and take-all root rot.
Planting after the Hessian fly-free date reduces the risk of
these diseases. Check your county K-State Research and
Extension agent for your local fly-free dates.
Seed Treatments
Seed treatments are excellent for control of
seedborne diseases such as common bunt and loose smut.
In order to keep our seed supply clean, seed treatments
are highly recommended for all seed production fields.
Seed treatments also can reduce seed rot and
seedling blight. Although seedling blight is not common
in Kansas, seed treatments may increase stands when
planting in poor conditions or using seed of poor vigor.
Certain seed treatments give partial control of barley
yellow dwarf, leaf rust, Septoria blotch, Stagonospora
blotch, powdery mildew, take-all root rot, common root
rot, or dryland foot rot. These seed treatments tend to be
more expensive and may fit best in high yielding,
intensively managed wheat fields. See your K-State
Research and Extension agent for recent ratings of wheat
seed treatments.
Certified Seed
Kansas certified seed has been inspected for
common bunt, loose smut, and Karnal bunt. Using
certified seed reduces the risk of introducing a seedborne
disease into the field.
Foliar Fungicides
Foliar fungicides are one of the few disease
management tools that can be used in the spring.
Fungicides can control leaf rust, tan spot, Septoria leaf
blotch, Stagonospora nodorum leaf blotch, and powdery
mildew. Degree of control ranges from poor to excellent,
depending on the particular disease, fungicide,
application timing, and rate.
Frequently the yield increase from fungicides is not
enough to pay for the pesticide application. Fungicides
are most likely to be economical in seed production
fields or high yield potential fields. See K-State Research
and Extension publication MF-1026, Wheat Foliar
Fungicides for further details.
Biocontrol
Biocontrol is the use of natural biological
competition, predation, or antagonism to control a pest.
Use of biocontrol to manage wheat diseases is currently
limited.
Biocontrol of take-all root rot often occurs naturally
in about the fourth or fifth year of continuous wheat
culture. This biocontrol, called “take-all decline,” keeps
the disease in check so that losses are low. Unfortunately,
crop rotation disrupts the biocontrol and losses can be
severe when the field is again planted to wheat. Since
take-all decline requires continuous wheat culture, its use
is limited.
Some new seed treatments consist of living spores of
biocontrol bacteria. It is likely that more biocontrol seed
treatments will be available in the future.
Balanced Fertility
Maintaining balanced fertility may reduce some
diseases. Chloride deficiency has been linked to greater
susceptibility to foliar diseases. Excess nitrogen can
promote the development of powdery mildew. Liming of
highly acid soils often triggers the activity of take-all root
rot in continuous wheat. More frequent liming to
maintain a more constant optimum pH may lessen
problems with take-all. Another strategy is to combine
liming with crop rotation to break the take-all cycle.

Insect Management
Look for cylindrical
yellow brown worms up
to 13/4 inches long. After
crop emergence, look
for skips in the drill row.
The larvae destroys the
seed. Damage may be
worse in dry soils.
Use seed treatment if
worms are detected prior to
planting in a dry seedbed.
One worm per 3 square
foot of row may be of
economic concern.
Eats leaf surface in
long, narrow streaks.
Destroys the leaf
surface on seedlings.
More common along
margins next to corn or
sorghum.
Three to five beetles per
square foot may justify
treatment, depending upon
seedling vigor, and stand
density and extent of
infested area.
Fall injury consists of
stunted tillers often with
an unusually large
broad green leaf.
Symptoms usually more
prominent from midOctober into early
November. Often worse
in early fields.
Look for chewing
damage to plants
around field margins
and next to infested
areas
Scout prior to planting,
three to five grasshoppers
per square yard should be
controlled–if possible prior
to planting.

Statewide, but fall infestations in
wheat are more likely to occur in the
southern areas of the state.
Occurs statewide, sometimes
more common in western areas of
the state.
Look for the C-shaped
grub larvae prior to
planting. Grubs feed on
roots and are usually
located at 2 to 4 inches
beneath the surface.
After planting, look for
pruned roots on
stressed or dying plants.
Consider delaying the
date of planting where
early-fall grub counts
average four to five or
more per square foot in
the upper 6-inch soil
layer.
Look for off-color spots
in field. Leaves may
have brownish spots,
later leaves may turn
yellow with light green
soft bodied insects on
underside of affected
leaves. Infestations
beneath the surface in
loose soils are not
uncommon.
Estimate number of
greenbugs per foot of drill
row. One way is place a
white sheet of paper on the
ground next to drill row and
shake plants over the
paper. Infestation is
becoming serious when
greenbugs average about
50 per foot on 3- to 6-inch
plants.
Greenbug
White Grub
Winter Grain Mite Irregular spots where
leaves reflect a silverish
cast. Scarring of tissue
toward ends of leaves,
brownish pinhead sized
mites with red legs
beneath plants on sunny
days.
Spraying may be necessary
on stunted, poorly tillered
wheat if six to 10 mites per
plant are common.
Primarily during the fall in central
and south central areas. More
common in continuous wheat.
Can be found statewide, but like the
greenbug, fall infestations are more
common in southern areas.
Generally, plants look
quite normal except for
sticky leaves, and
presence of small dark
olive-greenish aphids on
leaves, crowns or roots.
Bird Cherry-oat
Aphid
Feeding by this insect
rarely results in serious
plant damage, but it is most
important as a vector of
barley yellow dwarf.
Disease prevention through
aphid control has not been
historically feasible.
Watch for chewed for
missing plants. Begins
as small "windowpane"
scars on leaf surface. As
larvae get larger, they
may chew plants into the
ground.
Inspect daily in fields with
20 to 25 percent
"windowpane" damage,
Treat if signs of feeding
continues to increase.
Fall Armyworm
Attacks in the fall, watch early
planted fields. Fall armyworms
usually appear in September.
Pest Where and When to Look What to Look For Action to Take

Irregular spots may turn
brown after green up.
Brownish worms hide in
soil, feed on new spring
growth.
Pale to whitish worms
feed underground and
are usually found just
above the moisture line.
Damage common in
April and May. It
destroys roots, the
plants lose vigor and
die.
Pale Western Cutworm
Limited to the western third of
Kansas, more common in dry
weather
Infestations of two or
more worms per square
foot, are generally
considered damaging.
The Banks grass mite can be found
in the extreme western portion of
the state in field margins bordering
stubble, or crops during fall or early
spring.
Leaves finely mottled
and some webbing
along with very small
mostly transparent
mites on the undersides
of leaves. Mites often
enter in the fall from
nearby corn, milo or
stubble fields. They may
continue to push farther

Kansas irrigated wheat acreage has remained
relatively stable since an increase in the early 1980s to
between 700,000 to 800,000 acres (Figure 5). Irrigated
wheat production represents about one-fourth of the 3
million irrigated crop base and is the second most
commonly irrigated crop in the state, following corn.
Using average production figures for the past 5 years,
just less than 7 percent of harvested wheat acres are
irrigated and just over 10 percent of total production
comes from irrigated land. Reported yield figures
indicate irrigated land yields increases are 50 percent
more than average dryland yield. The impact is even
larger than this since most irrigated wheat production
occurs in fallow wheat production areas. The majority of
irrigated wheat production occurs in southwest Kansas.
Water Use Characteristics
Wheat can develop an extension root system with
penetration to 6 feet under favorable conditions. Most of
this growth occurs in the spring during the rapid growth
period after breaking of dormancy. A normal root
extraction pattern is to have about 70 percent of water
extraction occur in the upper one-half of the root zone.
However, root extraction studies have shown wheat
capable of extracting a substantial portion of its water
need from the lower portion of the root zone. Soil water
depletion levels can approach 80 percent of available
water without serious yield potential reductions at most
growth stages. However, the general recommendation
would be to maintain soil water at above 50 percent
depletion to maintain yield potential throughout the
growth cycle.
All crops have characteristic water use curves.
Summer grown crops have a bell shaped curve that
indicates low daily water use needs in the spring, rises to
a peak usually near the beginning of crop reproduction,
then falls as the crop approaches maturity. Wheat has the
same pattern, except that it begins its cycle in the fall and
is interrupted by a period of winter dormancy. Figure 6
illustrates the general shape of wheat’s water use curve.
After planting and emergence in the fall, water use
increases as wheat establishes itself until temperature
forces it into dormancy. Water use begins in the spring
with rapid water use increase corresponding to the rapid
period of growth between breaking from dormancy until
heading. Boot to heading may be the critical stage of
growth for wheat, although wheat is tolerant of water
stress throughout its life cycles. Peak daily water use
rates of wheat can approach 0.5 inches per day but
normally peak use rates will be around 0.35 inches per
day during heading and grain development. Water use
rates drop off rapidly after grain development.
Total seasonal water needs of wheat will vary widely
depending on weather conditions but are in the range of 16
to 24 inches for a wheat crop that is not water limited.
Improvements in varieties and management practices have
increased yields over time, but have not changed the water
use requirements of wheat. A summary of Texas wheat
research illustrates in Figure 7 that wheat water use (or ET)
has stayed constant over the shown period of time which
water use efficiency on the yield produced for each unit of
water use doubled. The effects are similar in Kansas.
Cumulative water use for wheat is shown in Figure
8, based on an early research work at Garden City. As
already indicated, even though varieties have changed
yield potential, disease resistance, etc., the water use by
wheat has not changed. About 20 percent of water use
will occur from emergence to the beginning of spring
growth, another 20 percent will be from spring growth to
jointing, 10 percent jointing to boot, 12 percent boot to

Net irrigation requirement as estimated in the Kansas
NRCS Irrigation Guide for average rainfall range from
about 12 inches in southwest Kansas to zero for eastern
Kansas. Dry rainfall year estimates (80 percent chance
rainfall) range from nearly 14 inches to about 3.5 inches
across Kansas. The net irrigation requirement change
across the state indicates why irrigated wheat production
is concentrated in southwest Kansas. This is where the
irrigation requirement is highest. Net irrigation
requirement (NIR) for the 80 percent chance rainfall year
are shown in Figure 9.
Irrigation Management
Much of Kansas’ irrigated wheat production occurs
on surface-irrigated deep silt loam soils, most often using
a single fall irrigation application. The fall application
amount is generally heavy, often in excess of 6 inches.
However this normally results in yields at or above the
good dryland fallow yields because of good stands and
full soil profile after irrigation. Normally, surface
distribution in the spring after rapid growth begins is not
practical for surface systems. Wheat that is being
irrigated with sprinkler systems can generally make
better use of applied irrigation water since a small
application depth can be efficiently applied in the fall to
assure good stand establishment and the remaining water
applied as needed during the spring growing season. This
allows better storage and utilization of both dormant and
growing season precipitation.
Soil water holding capacity has a large influence on
which management strategies will be successful. Heavy fall
irrigation works well on deep silt and silty clay loams with
available water holding capacities of 2.0 inches per feet or
more, but fall irrigation would be a failure on sandy soils
with holding capacities around 1.0 inch per foot or less.
Specific soils information can be obtained from county
soil surveys, although general soils information and
explanations can be obtained in KSU extension bulletin
L-904 Soil, Water, and Plant Relationships.
Wheat irrigation is frequently used as a method of
stretching the irrigation season since it has a growing
season that is different from the other commonly
irrigated but summer grown crops. Wheat also grows in a
period when the potential demand for water is lower, and
since wheat is relatively insensitive to water stress, long
periods of time are available to irrigate wheat, utilizing
low capacity wells, especially for individuals seeking to
move to continuous production rather than a dryland
fallow rotation.
Irrigation management strategies for full yield potential
need to include scheduling of irrigation application to
maintain soil water above 50 percent depletion. Stage of
growth applications can be used to obtain maximum yield
potential, but can be wasteful of water resources if water
level status of soil profile is ignored.
A summary of wheat trials in Garden City, shown in
Table 5, illustrates some of the different management
concepts. Although yield potential is greater now than at
the time of the study, as indicated by the previous
discussion of Figure 7, the treatment effects today are
similar. Fallow dryland yields are shown and indicate

extremely variable yield, since the previous year’s rainfall
also would have a large impact of stored water availability
in the soil profile, in addition to the in-season rainfall.
Preplant irrigation only is sufficient to obtain a
wheat yield, even in dry years although at less than full
yield potential. Preplant and boot irrigation yielded
essentially at the same level as did irrigation treatments
scheduled by observing soil water status. One problem
associated with this study is duplicating the treatment
effect in surface irrigated production fields. Essentially
surface production fields can only apply a fall preplant or
after emergence treatment and this and other studies
indicate this will be a reliable production strategy, but in
dry years some yield loss will occur.
Sprinkler systems generally will require 3 to 4
applications to duplicate the effect of the single heavy
application amount. This, however, is an advantage since
irrigations can be withheld if no water stress developed.
In general, scheduling by soil water status or crop water
use, will result in the highest yield potential with the
lowest irrigation water input over the long-term since
above normal rainfall years’ water will be better utilized,
thereby reducing irrigation demand.
Summary
Any amount of water applied to wheat under the
normal growing conditions of western Kansas and in
most years in central Kansas will result in a yield
increase. Successful wheat irrigation management is
really a matter of understanding the irrigation system
limitations and the soil water status. Most surface
systems cannot efficiently apply water after spring
growth occurs, so they are limited to fall water
applications, which should achieve yields at or above
good dryland fallow yields.
Irrigators using sprinkler systems should not apply
heavy fall irrigations. Since sprinkler system operators have
the option of applying additional irrigation at any time after
the dormant season ends, the soil profile can be left with
room to store winter and early spring precipitation. Wheat
water use is low during this time because the crop is small
and temperatures are cool. This means irrigation systems
with limited capacity can build up soil water reserves,
should an unusually dry winter occur. However, as wheat
approaches jointing, soil water availability should not be
allowed to deplete to less than 50 percent available
throughout the remainder of the growing season. The
estimated net irrigation requirement for wheat is about 15
inches in extreme southwest Kansas. If irrigation application
amounts routinely exceed this level, the irrigator needs to
consider whether improvements can be made in irrigation
efficiency or if an improved irrigation water scheduling
method can be employed.

Harvest Suggestions
Today’s modern, high-capacity combines are
designed to do an excellent job of threshing and cleaning
wheat. All too often, however, part of the crop is left in
the field or the quality of the grain harvested is less than
desirable. Even in good harvesting conditions, combine
losses as high as 10 bushels per acre of wheat can occur
in Kansas. In most cases, a few minor adjustments can
drastically reduce losses or improve grain quality. Since
any additional wheat saved is clear profit and clean
samples are not docked, a little extra attention to combine
adjustment can pay off.
Preliminary Adjustments
As a general rule, start with the machine adjusted
according to the specifications in the operator’s manual.
Engine speed is often taken for granted, but it is one of
the most important adjustments of all. If the engine speed
is too slow, separator speed will also be too low and
performance will suffer.
Once the combine is adjusted and ready to harvest,
be prepared to fine tune it as required. To fine-tune a
combine, the functions of the machine and how they
32
relate must be considered. The combine’s five basic
functions are; cutting and feeding, threshing, separating,
cleaning, and handling. The crop moves through the
combine in this order. So if one function is not
performing adequately, the areas that follow will have
performance related problems. For example, if the header
is too low and excess straw is entering the combine,
threshing and separation will be difficult because of the
excess material.
Cutting and feeding take place at the header and
feeder house. Adjustments include header or cutting
height, reel height and speed and reel position fore/aft.
Cutting height is controlled by the operator as conditions
change. The goal should be to harvest all grain with
minimal chaff and straw. The reel should be adjusted to
gently move wheat into the cutterbar by positioning it
slightly ahead of the cutterbar. It should turn slightly
faster than ground speed and be far enough down in the
wheat to lay the heads onto the platform. Make sure the
sickle is sharp and in good condition. A dull sickle can
limit ground speed and cause shatter loss. Crop feeding
from the header should be uniform to ensure proper
threshing.
Threshing occurs at the cylinder or front portion of
the rotor and is affected by concave clearance and
cylinder/rotor speed. Cylinder/rotor speed determines
how much grain damage will occur and the amount of
seeds threshed from the head. Clearance will determine
how many seeds are separated and drop through the
concaves. Ideally threshing removes all grain from the
head without damaging grain or straw.
Cylinder adjustment is also important since it affects
the performance of the rest of the machine. First, verify
that the cylinder clearance indicator on the machine is
accurate. The bars and concaves may be worn such that
the clearance is greater than shown by the pointer. The
concave and cylinder must be parallel from side-to-side
and the cylinder-concave clearance must have the correct
convergence from front-to-rear. The operator’s manual
should include detailed instructions on checking and
adjusting these items.
Underthreshing, or not completely removing grain
from the head, makes separation difficult. It occurs when
concave spacing is too wide or cylinder speed is too
slow. Overthreshing is indicated by the straw being
pulverized and broken up. As a result, part of the straw
may overload the shoe, thus carrying grain over the back
of the shoe. Other symptoms of overthreshing are
cracked grain and excessive amounts of return. The
cracked grain is more likely to be blown over the shoe,
and even if retained in the grain tank, it causes problems
in handling and storage. To avoid overthreshing, set the
cylinder no faster and no tighter than absolutely
necessary to thresh the grain from the heads. Some
operators prefer to leave an occasional kernel in the head
as a sign of the best balance in threshing action.
Since threshing plays an important role in grain
cleaning, the cleaning shoe should not be adjusted until
satisfactory threshing occurs. Shoe losses can be caused by
several factors in addition to overthreshing. Narrow
chaffer openings can cause grain to be carried over, as can
improper fan adjustment. If the chaffer is opened too wide,
it will overload the sieve and increase tailings. Chaffer and
shoe openings are measured perpendicular to the louvers.
An underblown condition at the shoe occurs when
material is not adequately suspended in the air over the
chaffer. This is caused by narrow openings or insufficient
airflow. Grain should fall through the first two-thirds of
the chaffer. If there is a thick mat of material on the shoe,
grain cannot fall through and is carried over the rear of
the shoe.
If chaffer openings are too narrow, grain through
them is limited, increasing losses and limiting the overall
capacity of the combine. Changing chaffer openings also
affects air velocity and direction; therefore they should
be adjusted together. Ideally chaffer airflow and
movement suspends material over the chaffer and allows
kernels to drop through to the sieve. Sieve openings
should be set large enough to let all grain through
without allowing foreign material into the grain bin.
However if they are closed to keep foreign material out,
returns should be monitored to ensure there is not too
much grain being recycled.
Manufacturers have greatly improved the cleaning
area on newer combines by developing new fans and
precleaners. Many changes in machines have focused on
achieving more uniform airflow across the cleaning shoe.
These changes have improved the overall performance of
the combine. Air type chaffers are popular as aftermarket
equipment for combines. Some of these are adjustable
and others are not, but most of them do a good job of
removing large straw fragments.
Combine Capacity
Combine capacity is the maximum rate at which a
properly adjusted combine can harvest a crop while
maintaining an acceptable loss level. Capacity may be
limited not only by cutting and feeding or power
limitations, but also by the performance of any of the
functional areas of threshing, separating, or cleaning. It is
important to relate capacity to an acceptable overall loss
level. A common limitation on conventional combines in
wheat is straw walker overload. If the combine is pushed
beyond a reasonable rate, walker overloading causes the
losses to increase rapidly.
With constant crop conditions, feed rate will be
proportional to ground speed. At low to moderate feed rates,
much of the grain is actually separated in the concave area.
33
About 90 percent of the separation should occur in the
concave, leaving only 10 percent for straw walkers. At
higher feed rates, the amount of separation in the concave
area is drastically reduced so more grain is passed onto the
walkers, resulting in excessive separating losses.
The only way to reduce walker losses is to slow down.
Reducing ground speed by 25 percent on an overloaded
combine can easily cut harvesting losses in half.
High Quality Wheat
Combine adjustment can affect wheat quality in two
fundamental ways: grain damage and cleanliness. Grain
damage consists of cracked and broken kernels that make
wheat harder to handle, generate dust, harbor insects, and
increase mold growth. Damaged grain also can be hidden
in that the operator may not see it. Some damaged grain
may end up in the bin, but a high portion will probably
go out the back of the machine in the form of flour and
small fragments. Generally 0.5 to 2 percent grain damage
is achievable, but it can be much higher.
Grain damage occurs mainly in the threshing area of
the combine, but also can be caused in the clean grain
conveying system. In hard threshing wheat, there is a
trade-off between thorough threshing and grain damage.
An operator may not be able to completely thresh the
crop without causing damage. Grain damage is usually
caused by excessive cylinder/rotor speed. If slowing the
cylinder/rotor speed doesn’t improve the grain sample,
adjustment of the concave clearance may be needed.
Foreign material also contributes to a lower quality
wheat sample. Some weed seeds, especially cheat and
downy brome, are difficult to separate from wheat. A
good way to help is to harvest cheat infested fields last.
Drier cheat is easier to clean and the yield in ‘cleaner’
fields is probably higher which makes them more
important. Some general adjustments for cheat infested
fields are:
• Chaffer toward open end of recommended range,
• sieve toward closed end of recommended range, and
• fan toward high end.
Following these guidelines will probably cause
returns to increase, so keep an eye on machine capacity
to avoid plugging.
Also watch your travel patterns when dealing with
cheat. The combine is a serious vector for weed seed. It
typically takes more than 1 minute to fully discharge
cheat from a combine. If the combine is cutting cheat
along the edge of a field, it can carry it 200 yards or
farther into the field before it is through.
Estimating Your Losses
Checking the machine frequently is the best way to
ensure efficient harvesting. During a single afternoon,
conditions can change enough to require resetting some
of the machine’s components. A few simple ground
counts will give an indication of combine performance.
As a general rule, it takes about 20 kernels of wheat per
square foot to equal one bushel per acre when spread
evenly across the field. The only item needed to check
losses is a one square foot frame made out of heavy wire
to carry on the combine or in the grain truck. Follow
these steps to determine losses:
1. Cut through a typical area at the usual speed, then stop
the combine and back up about 20 feet.
2. In the area behind the separator discharge, lay the one
foot square frame down three times and take ground
counts (see Figure 10). Average the three counts. This
is the separator count.
3. In the area between the cutterbar and the standing
wheat, take three more ground counts and average
them. Don’t forget to look for heads. This is the
header count.
4. Take a final three ground counts in the standing wheat
and average them. This is the preharvest count.
5. Calculate header loss in bushels per acre.
Header loss = Header count – Preharvest count
20
6. Calculate the separator loss in bushels per acre.
Separator loss =Separator count – Header count
80
Since header width for most combines is about four
times as wide as the separator, it takes about 80 kernels
per square foot behind the separator discharge to equal 1

Wheat stored on or off farm must be kept free of
insects, fungi, rodents or other pests to ensure acceptance
by domestic and foreign grain buyers. Low levels of
insect infestations can develop into damaging
populations before the grain reaches its final destination.
Integrated pest management techniques during wheat
storage require proper use of sanitation, chemicals,
monitoring and aeration to maintain the wheat quality.
Potential Effect of Deteriorated Wheat
Many physical factors (moisture content, test weight,
shrunken and broken kernel content, etc.) affect the
market quality, and therefore, the price of wheat, but only
a few are normally affected by deterioration during
storage. The economic impact of deterioration depends
on the type and severity of the damage.
Damaged Kernel (DKT) count may increase if molds
are allowed to discolor the germs. Discounts may range
from $0.01 per bushel to $0.15 per bushel or more
depending on the percent DKT. The presence of live
insects often causes the price to be discounted $0.05 per
bushel to $0.10 per bushel. Uncontrolled mold or insect
deterioration may result in objectionable odors or
increase the number of Insect Damaged Kernels (IDK).
This may cause the wheat to be designated sample grade
with discounts of $0.10 per bushel, or more, or rejection.
IDK are a type of damage produced by lesser grain
borers or weevils, and contribute to the DKT count as
well as usually provoking a discount of $0.03 per bushel
or more, depending on the severity of the damage. Certain
preferred buyers, such as flour mills, usually reject grain
with live insects or more than 5 IDK per 100 grams.

bushel per acre if no spreading devices are being used. If
your combine has a bat type spreader, use 65 kernels per
square foot instead of 80. If you have a straw chopper,
use 50 and if you also have a chaff spreader, use 25.
What are acceptable losses? This depends on the
condition of the crop as well as the attitude of the
operator. However, for standing wheat under good
harvesting conditions, machine losses can usually be held
to 2 percent of the total yield. Higher losses will have to
be tolerated in downed or damaged wheat.
Although simple to perform, the ground counts can be
time consuming. It may be more practical to have the truck
or grain cart driver perform the separator ground count
periodically during the day. This allows the combine to
continue harvesting while the count is being made.
Correcting Your Losses
Since there are many factors that can create combine
losses, an organized approach to correcting the problem
is needed. Figure 11 shows one method for pinpointing
the cause of the lost grain. When fine tuning a machine,
try to change only one thing at a time so that the effects
can be seen. Keep referring to the operator’s manual; it
seldom pays to deviate very far from suggested settings.
35
Preventing discounts requires sanitation, monitoring,
aeration, and proper use of chemicals.
DKT produced by mold is the simplest damage to
prevent, since it is caused by excess moisture somewhere
in the grain mass. Wheat should be stored at 13 percent
or less moisture content. Insect control is the most
difficult part of farm wheat storage since incoming wheat
must be held through the summer before cool weather
arrives. Discounts related to insect presences or IDK can
be minimized using integrated pest management (IPM)
techniques. Moisture migration and condensation can be
prevented with proper aeration.
“What is the minimum insect density at which
fumigation is cost-effective?” is a common question
relative to insect control. The following guidelines are
based on available field research and surveys. However,
they are not applicable in every situation, and one’s local
elevator or mill should be consulted to determine their
insect thresholds. These guidelines assume that the wheat
will be moved to market in the winter and that the
objective is to keep insect levels below detectable levels.
• If more than two insects are found in samples, take a
total of five samples from each bin.
• If lesser grain borers or weevils (internal feeders) are
found in more than one sample, or if more than one of
these insects is found in a single sample, fumigation
may be necessary unless the entire grain mass can be
cooled to below 50°F within 3 weeks.
• If only external-feeding insects (flat or rusty grain
beetles, flour beetles, meal moths, sawtooth or
merchant grain beetles, etc.) are found, an average of
two per sample is usually acceptable if the grain can
be cooled to below 50°F within 2 months.
Structures
The structure in which wheat is binned can help
prevent loss and quality deterioration during storage.
Structures used for grain storage should:
1. Hold the grain without loss from leaks or spills.
2. Prevent rain, snow, or soil moisture from reaching the
grain.
3. Protect grain from rodents, birds, poultry,
objectionable odors, and theft.
4. Provide safety from fire and wind damage.
5. Permit effective treatment to prevent or control insect
infestation.
6. Provide headroom over the binned grain for sampling,
inspecting, and ventilating.
A suitable storage for grain includes a weather-tight,
rodent-proof, metal structure that is separated from hay
and feed areas and animal housing. It should be easy to
clean and inspect. It should have an aeration system that
will allow you to cool the grain and thus limit insect
development, and minimize moisture migration through
the grain.
Insect Development
In Kansas, over 20 different species of insects are
adapted to survive in grain or grain products. Common
stored grain insects have a life cycle of 4 to 12 months.
They may pass from egg to adult under optimal
conditions in 30 days or less. Females of some common
species can leave 300 or more eggs in the wheat within a
few weeks. Not all insects cause damage and it is
important to be able to recognize those that do, such as
lesser grain borers or weevils.
Insect reproduction is directly related to temperature
through the life requirement ranges. Optimal feeding and
reproduction of most storage insects typically occurs
from 70° to 90° F. Recent research has shown that
optimum conditions for lesser grain borer are between
90° and 110° F for dry wheat. The lesser grain borer is
the most damaging insect in Kansas farm stored wheat.
As grain temperatures drop near 60° F, reproduction falls
off rapidly. Most visible insect activity, including
feeding, ceases when grain temperatures fall below 50°F.
Sanitation
Sanitation is critical to maintaining wheat quality
while in storage. The optimum time to clean a bin is
immediately after emptying and again 4 to 6 weeks prior
to refilling. Critical areas where infestation can normally
be found include the floor area and unloading pits or
sumps. Other areas may include the bin walls, ladder
rungs, and openings if debris (webbing, kernels, etc.)
remains attached to them after unloading. Handling
equipment should be used to remove debris and aeration
ducts removed and cleaned. The area around a bin must
also be kept free of debris, not only while the grain is in
storage, but also while the bin is empty.
Nearby grain or feed storage bins, feed processing
centers or livestock feeders can provide breeding sites for
insects. Insects also harbor over the winter inside
combines, trucks, or handling equipment. Harvesting and
handling equipment need to be cleaned following harvest
and then scoured as soon as harvest begins. New grain
“scours out” the machinery and removes a potential source
of infestation. This “scoured” wheat should be fed to
livestock rather than sold to prevent infesting other wheat.
When it is binned, newly harvested grain will most
likely be at optimum temperature and moisture
conditions for insect development. Breeding areas in the
immediate storage area are an important source of insects
that may invade newly stored grain. Unless steps are
taken to prevent this crossover infestation, several
generations of insects could develop before cold weather
impacts the insects’ reproduction cycle.
New grain should not be stored on top of grain that
has been in storage. If the old grain has even a low-level
infestation, the problem will spread upward into the most
recently added grain. Extensive “hidden” damage may
36
result before the infestation reaches the surface layer
where problems are more readily detected. A precautionary
fumigation of old wheat should be undertaken if new
wheat has to be stored on top of existing wheat.
Bin Wall Treatments
 Bin wall treatments help eliminate insects remaining
in the cleaned structure. Structural sprays are used 4 to 6
weeks before grain enters storage. After cleaning the
structure thoroughly, walls, roof, and floor should be
sprayed as directed on the label. Posttreatment waiting
intervals before binning the grain should be in accordance
to product label. If more than 3 months elapse from
treatment to filling of the bin, a second bin-wall treatment
may be useful. A second treatment must be permitted by
the product label and applied accordingly.
Malathion, Methoxychlor®, and Reldan® treatments
are registered for wheat storage structures. Malathion
cannot be used if soybeans are the next crop to be stored
in the structure. Cyfluthrin (marketed as Tempo®)
recently has been labeled as an empty structure spray.
Like Methoxychlor®, Tempo® cannot be applied directly
to any grains. Refer to product labels for information on
application rates and procedures.
Protectants
Grain protectants are insecticides designed to be
placed on the grain kernels entering storage. Grain
protectants retain their insect-toxic properties for an
extended time period, depending on the grain moisture
content and temperature. They are not highly volatile and
penetration into infested kernels is very limited.
Protectants do not destroy eggs and internally feeding
insects since fatal amounts of insecticide are probably not
absorbed by these forms after application.
Malathion and chlorpyrifos-methyl are the major
ingredients labeled for direct wheat application as a grain
“protectant” at this writing. Of these two products, the
active ingredient in Reldan® (chlorpyrifos-methyl) has
demonstrated longer lasting residual control in several
research trials, especially where wheat with higher than
recommended moisture contents has been treated.
Chlorpyrifos-methyl also is more widely recognized as
effective against Indian meal moth larvae than currently
labeled rates of malathion. Some export and domestic
customers are now purchasing only wheat without
chemical residue.
Some types of inert dusts (diatomaceous earth, etc.)
are available for use as protectants against grain storage
insects. Inert dusts may increase grain-handling
machinery wear due to their abrasive characteristics.
There also has been some indication that test weights
may change following the application of an inert dust to
some grains. Inert dusts must carry specific label mention
of stored grains to be used this way in Kansas. Limited
data from field scale trials is available at this writing.
Surface Treatments
Split applications may perform more consistently
when applying surface dressings. Labels may recommend
to divide the product into two or three lots. Apply the lots
to the grain surface based on the label recommendations.
Most protectants cannot be used as surface dressings if
they have been used applied as a protectant during binning
since the maximum residue tolerance may be exceeded.
Slow-release DDVP or dichlorvos strips and several
formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis, a biological
insecticide, are available for use against Indian meal
moth adults and larvae, respectively. The strips are hung
in the overspace at the rate of 1 strip per 1,000 cubic feet
and release a volatile insecticide that permeates the air. In
contrast, Bacillus thuringiensis, is mixed with the surface
4 to 6 inches of grain and kills young Indian meal moth
larvae that feed on the treated grain.
Fumigants
Fumigants rapidly form penetrating gases when
released from the container used to transport them. These
gases readily move into infested kernels and should
eliminate all insect life stages if applied properly.
Fumigants do not provide residual protection so
reinfestation can occur immediately after the grain has
been “aired out” and gas concentrations fall below lethal
levels. Field studies in Kansas found October to be the
optimum time to fumigate farm-stored wheat, if
treatment became necessary. Covering the surface with
plastic was required for effective fumigation. Fumigants
are restricted use products. Fumigation requires
specialized training and well-maintained application,
monitoring, and safety equipment. It can be fatal to the
user if recommended label procedures are not closely
followed. Data from research in Kansas in 1991 showed
that 35 percent of Kansas farmers who fumigated some
wheat used a commercial applicator. Unless a producer is
willing to invest the time and money necessary to acquire
the equipment and knowledge needed, fumigation should
be left to reputable professionals.
Aeration
The purpose of aeration is to cool the wheat. This
reduces an insect’s ability to reproduce in it and
minimizes temperature gradients. Aeration cools grain by
forcing ambient air through the wheat with fans. Grain is
cooled using aeration or drying fans. Aeration fans move
less than 1
/3 cubic foot of air per minute per bushel (cfm/
bu) through the storage structure. Approximately 80 to
120 hours are required to cool the grain depending on the
airflow rate. The difference between the grain
temperature and outdoor air temperature should be a
minimum of 10°F before an aeration fan is turned on. At
harvest, when temperatures are above 90°F, a 20°F
differential should be used before operating the fans.
37
Drying fans move 1
/2 to 1 cfm/bu through the grain and
require less than 24 hours to cool a bin. Temperature
differences of 15°F between grain and air are
recommended when aerating with a drying fan.
Simple or complex automated aeration controllers
are available. Controllers automatically turn a fan on
based on preset weather and grain conditions.
Automatically controlled aeration fans will cool grain 6
to 8 weeks earlier when compared to manually controlled
aeration fans. Automated aeration controllers can be
effective in cooling grain in storage earlier, thus
minimizing the crossover impact, by running aeration
fans only when the outdoor temperatures are below a
preset temperature.
Stored grain contains moisture that can be
transferred within a bin primarily in response to
temperature differences. Differences develop either when
the surface or perimeter areas around the bin cool or heat
due to outdoor air conditions or because of insect or mold
activity. Moisture transfer can result in damp areas within
a mass of grain that are favorable for mold development.
Temperature differences can be controlled with aeration.
Moving the air up through the grain is generally
recommended and requires exhaust vents or roof
openings. After the grain has been cooled, the aeration
fan needs to be covered if the fan is not automated with a
controller. This prevents rodents from entering beneath
the grain and reduces the potential for air currents
transferring moisture within the grain. The wheat should
be clean and level on top to assure uniform air movement
throughout the mass. Aeration is ineffective in cooling
wheat located in peaks. Peaking wheat also creates
breeding grounds for insects and molds and presents
special problems when fumigating.
Monitoring
Best management practices require monthly
inspection throughout the storage period. Risk of major
deterioration can effectively be eliminated by frequent
monitoring. Monitoring requires a grain probe, moisture
meter, temperature measuring device, and screening
pans. Changes in moisture content, insect activity, odor,
or temperature can best be detected by inspections. An
inspection log or diary should be maintained for future
reference.
Monitoring is more than simply scooping grain from
the surface, especially if it has been cooled. Insects may
concentrate near the top of the grain and give a false
impression of the infestation level. Warm weather
infestations generally are near the grain surface or areas
below the points of entry. A monthly approach to sampling
is to sieve several samples probed from each bin.
Pest Control Decisions
The results of sampling will tell you if sanitation and
management were successful in controlling insects.
There are three basic management strategies for
storing wheat. These do not began to include all possible
combinations of management strategies using
protectants, fumigation and aeration. All began with
proper sanitation and require frequent monitoring.
A maximum input/low risk strategy costs between
$.025 to $.03 per bushel (assuming no fumigation is
needed) and involves:
1. Applying a protectant at binning,
2. Summer aeration to equalize moisture and temperature
differences,
3. Fumigating prior to November 1 if necessary, and
4. Aerating in late fall to cool wheat below 50°F.
Studies indicate Reldan® is generally more effective
than malathion. If the protectant is properly applied and
recommended sanitation and monitoring practices are
followed, no fumigation may be required. A chemical
residue does remain on the wheat when using this
strategy.
Another practice is a fumigation/aeration strategy
which involves:
1. Applying no protectant at binning,
2. Scheduled or routine fumigation in the early fall,
3. Continuous aeration in early fall to cool wheat below
75°F, and
4. Aeration in late fall to cool wheat below 45°F.
Cost for a fumigation-aeration strategy ranges from
$0.015 to $0.035 per bushel. Proper aeration is critical
during the late summer and prior to first fumigation to
avoid having to re-fumigate. Temperature range
guidelines provided by the fumigant manufacturer should
be followed to obtain the most effective fumigation.
More recent field studies indicate that an
automatically controlled aeration strategy can be an
effective practice and involves:
1. Cooling wheat below 75°F by late August,
2. Cooling wheat by late September to 60°F,
3. Fumigation, if necessary, in early fall and
4. Continuing to cool the wheat below 45°F.
The wheat cools gradually or in intermittent periods
since the fan runs only when the outdoor air temperature
and/or humidity is below the controller set point.
Automatically controlled aeration costs range from
$0.005 to $0.01 per bushel with the controller’s initial cost
between $300 and $2,500, depending on complexity. This
strategy can be managed manually, avoids the problem of
chemical residue, and has a lower cost. This strategy has
been field tested on farms in Kansas and performed well.
Because of economic, environmental, and food
safety concerns, chemical treatment of grain should be
minimal unless insect thresholds are exceeded or longterm storage is desired.
38
Kansas has long been known as the “bread basket” of
the world because of its ability to produce high- quality
wheat. Kansas consistently ranks number one or two in the
production of wheat, with 18.7 and 13.1 percent of the
total U.S. wheat crop in 1994 and 1995, respectively.
The total acres of wheat harvested in Kansas
remained fairly stable during the period 1993-95 at about
11.17 million acres or about 52.5 percent of the state’s
harvested crop acres. In 1995, 11.0 million acres of
wheat were harvested. Approximately 286.0 million
bushels of wheat were produced for an average yield of
26.0 bushels per harvested acre.
Each producer must answer two questions when
selecting crops and the acreage of each crop to produce
are: (1) Will this choice be profitable? (2) Will this add
more to the total net income of my farm operation than
other choices? That is, is this the most profitable choice?
The fixed or overhead costs of land and machinery
ownership for wheat, soybeans, corn, and grain sorghum
will be basically equal for the production period under
consideration. Therefore, the variable costs associated
with each crop are the costs that need to be considered
when selecting a given crop. Variable costs include:
labor, seed, herbicide, insecticide, fertilizer, fuel, oil,
repairs, crop insurance, drying, custom work, crop
consulting, and miscellaneous.
Variable costs will vary depending on the
management practices used, tillage operations, labor
efficiency, and type and fertility of the land. Each
producer should develop the variable costs of production
for wheat and any other crop alternatives. Expected yield
and selling price need to be determined for each crop
alternative.
Budgeted variable costs by item are shown for
dryland wheat production in western, south central, north
central, northeast, and southeast Kansas, and for irrigated
wheat production. A producer may have higher or lower
costs than presented in these budgets.
The prices used in these tables are not price
forecasts. They are used to indicate the method of
computing expected returns above variable costs. These
projections should be considered valid only under the
costs, production levels and prices specified. Individuals
or groups using the information provided should
substitute costs, production levels, and prices valid for
the locality, management level to be adopted, marketing
circumstances for the location, and time period involved.
The decision to plant wheat or another crop
alternative can be made by comparing the expected
returns above variable costs for each crop. Returns above
variable costs will depend on yields and prices. Each
producer should use yields that are reasonable for the
land or classes of land operated.
The decision to produce wheat will depend primarily
on the costs and expected returns for wheat in
comparison with other crop alternatives. However, the
producer should take into account other variables such as
previous crop rotation, livestock operation, and the
machinery and labor requirements of each crop.
The type and amount of equipment, crop rotations,
and farm size all affect the cost of producing crops. The
tillage practices used and their timing, also affect yields
and production costs. Each producer should compute the
expected returns above variable costs for the farm
operation as a means of selecting the crops and acreage
of each crop to produce. When computing expected
returns above variable costs, consider a number of price
alternatives.
