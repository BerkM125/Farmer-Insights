Introduction

Leo Espinoza and Jeremy Ross
North American Indians practically saved the
early settlers from starvation during their first winter
by sharing their corn. In fact, Indians of North and
Central America had grown corn for several
thousand years prior to the arrival of the first settlers.
Early Arkansas settlers made corn a very
important part of their agricultural operations.
Before 1950 (from records going back to 1866)
more than 1 million acres of corn were harvested
each year. Increasing demand and attractive crop
prices for cotton, rice and soybeans resulted in the
decline of corn production in the state to less than
100,000 acres (Figure Intro-1). The increasing nematode pressure in soils planted to cotton and soybeans, in addition to high yield potentials and new
market opportunities, have resulted in a 100 percent
increase in corn acreage in the last couple of years.
Corn yields remained relatively flat prior to
1950, with state average yields being 18 bushels per
acre. Today, thanks to more and improved hybrids
developed by public and private breeding programs,
as well as more efficient fertilizer, irrigation, pest
management and marketing practices, average corn
yields in Arkansas are in the 140 to 145 bushels per
acre range. These yield levels represent a 2.5 bushels
per acre increase per year since 1950, and it is very
close to average yields observed in traditional corn
producing states (Table Intro-1).
The Corn and Grain Sorghum Research
Verification Program (CGSRVP) is contributing
significantly toward increasing state corn yields.
This program began in 2000, and is funded solely
by Arkansas growers through Check-off contributions. The CGSRVP uses Extension management

recommendations to produce a high yielding,
economical corn crop. Information from CGSRVP
fields is used to improve and refine production
recommendations to meet the needs of Arkansas
corn farmers, in addition to identifying areas in need
of more research. Through the 2002 growing
season, 27 corn fields had been enrolled in the
CGSRVP, with economic information collected on
each CGSRVP field to estimate crop expenditures
and returns.
Extension specialists and researchers with the
University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture
developed this handbook. Arkansas corn growers,
through the Arkansas Corn and Grain Sorghum
Promotion Board, provided the financial resources
to create the handbook.
The handbook should be used as a reference
guide. It contains information on topics such as
hybrid selection, soil and water management, plant
nutrition, integrated pest management, harvesting,
and safety considerations in the production of corn
under Arkansas conditions. Due to constant changes
in laws that regulate pesticide use, the reader is
encouraged to contact the appropriate Extension
office for the most current information.

1 - Growth and Development

Leo Espinoza
Corn seeds, growing under the right conditions,
will eventually grow into small factories with the
ability to produce ample amounts of food. Understanding the conditions under which a seed may
properly germinate, develop into a plant, and
produce grain should help us prepare and manage
the crop to achieve expected yields.
The yield of a corn plant depends on the genetic
potential of a given hybrid, in addition to a number
of environmental conditions and in-season management. Although there is little a corn grower can do
about mother nature and the genetics of a plant
(other than selecting the hybrid best adapted to a
given location, and properly supplementing the
site’s inherent fertility and availability of water), in
many instances yield losses may be due to poor
planning and management, factors that are under the
control of a grower.
The seed is obviously the starting point. It
consists of three major parts: the pericarp, the
endosperm and the embryo (Figure 1-1). The
pericarp is the outer part of the seed, and is made up
of several cell layers, which act as barriers to
diseases and moisture loss. The endosperm is the
seed’s food storage compartment, which contains
Figure 1-1. Components of a corn seed.

of a Corn Plant

V1 first leaf R2 blister
V2 second leaf R3 milk
V3 third leaf R4 dough
V(n) nth leaf R5 dent
VT tasseling R6 physiological maturity
starches, minerals, proteins and other compounds.
The embryo is in reality a miniature plant consisting
of several parts: the plumule (leaves) at one end, the
radicle (roots) at the other end, and the sculletum
which absorbs nutrients stored in the endosperm.
When a seed is placed in moist soil, it absorbs
water which in turn dissolves the nutrients stored in
the endosperm. These nutrients are then absorbed by
the embryo through the sculletum. The radicle will
emerge from the seed and will eventually become
the plant’s root system. Leaves (plumule) also start
to grow at this time. Under Arkansas conditions it
may take between 5 and 21 days for a seedling to
emerge, with depth of planting, soil moisture and
soil temperature all significantly affecting the time
required for seedling emergence.
A system to identify crop growth stages was
developed by researchers from Iowa State University.
This system classifies growth stages into vegetative
(V) and reproductive (R) stages (Table 1-1), with
each stage designated numerically as V1, V2, V3
and so on. Each number represents the uppermost
3 
As stated before, it may take 4 to 5 days
for a seedling to emerge if conditions are
appropriate, but up to 21 days if they are not
favorable. The radicle is the first part of the
seed to begin elongation, with VE (emergence) observed when the growing coleoptile
reaches the soil surface. The nodal root
system is established around VE and
eventually becomes the supplier for water and
nutrients (Figure 1-3).
During the next two to three weeks
following seedling emergence the plant is
fairly resistant to hail and other stresses,
since the growing point is still below ground.
By the V3 stage, although still very young,
the plant has already finished deciding
how many leaves and ear shoots is going
to produce.
Figure 1-2. Corn plant at the V5 growth
stage. Leaf collar of 6th leaf is not visible.
leaf with a visible collar, with the leaf collar
being a visible light-colored narrow band at
the base of the leaf (Figure 1-2). The last
vegetative stage is named VT, to denote
tasseling. The last branch of the tassel is
visible at this time, while the silks are not.
This classification system allows for a
relatively easy way to identify growth stages
when plants are young but, as they grow, it
requires more detailed examination since
plants will eventually slough off their first
three to four leaves. Also, early-maturing
hybrids may develop fewer leaves or
progress through different stages at a faster
rate than late-maturing hybrids. Consideration should also be given to the fact that
plants in a given field may show different
growth stages; for that reason a stage
should be assigned only when 50 percent
or more of the plants are in or beyond
that stage. Figure 1-3. Corn seedling at the V1 (almost V2) growth stage.

By the time the plant reaches the V6 stage
(plants are normally “knee high”), the growing point
and tassel are above the ground and the plant
becomes much more susceptible to stresses. At the
V6 to V8 stage, the plant will experience a rapid
rate of growth, with proper and sufficient
fertilization and irrigation, which are critical at
these stages. The number of rows per ear is
established around this time, and the lowest two
leaves are no longer present.
The tassel develops rapidly (inside the stalk)
and the stalk continues elongating during the V9 to
V10 stages. Soil nutrients and water are in greater
demand at this time, and upon dissecting a corn
plant at the V9 stage, ear shoots become visible.
The period between V12 and V17 is particularly
important since the number of ovules (kernels) per
ear and the size of the ear are being determined.
Moisture and nutrient deficiencies during this
time may result in unfilled kernels and light ears.
The tip of the tassel as well as the tip of the ears
may be visible by the time the plant reaches the
V17 stage, and silks have started to appear at this
time. Stress during the V18 stage will delay silking
until after the pollen sheds, with ovules that silk
after completion of pollen shed not filling and
consequently not contributing to final grain yield.
Tasseling (VT), the last vegetative stage, begins a
few days before silk emergence. At this time the
plant has reached full height, with pollen shed
occurring primarily during late mornings. Silks that
have not emerged by this time will not be pollinated,
and consequently will not be developed.
The reproductive stages (R) relate to the
development of the kernels, with the R1 stage being
characterized by the silks being visible outside the
husks. It is defined when even a single silk strand is
visible from the tip of the husk. Every potential
ovule (kernel) on an ear develops its own silk, with
environmental stresses and especially the lack of
water resulting in poor pollination and in some
cases a bald ear tip. Pollination occurs when the
pollen grains are captured by moist silks, with this
process moving progressively from kernels near the
base of the ear to the tip ear kernels. Kernels reach
the R2 (blister) stage about two weeks after silking;
at this time they physically resemble tiny blisters.
Starch has begun to accumulate in the endosperm,
with moisture being around 85 percent.
The milk stage (R3) is generally observed a
week after blister. Fluid inside the kernels is milky
white due to the accumulation of starch, and the
silks turn brown and dry. The milk line can easily
be seen by breaking a cob in half. Starch continues
accumulating in the endosperm at the R4 (dough)
stage. The milky fluid thickens and attains a doughy
consistency, with moisture content being around 70
percent. The R5 (dent) stage is normally reached a
week after the R4 stage, and is recognized by the
appearance of the starch layer. This layer appears as
a line across the kernel that separates the liquid
(milky) and solid (starchy) areas of the kernels. As
the kernel matures, this line progressively moves
toward the cob. Kernel moisture has decreased to
55 percent, and any stress at this stage will affect
kernel weight only, since kernel number has already
been decided.
Kernels reach physiological maturity (R6)
two to three weeks after R5 (dent), and no
further increases in dry weight will be observed.
The starch layer has reached the cob, and a black
layer is formed. Black layer formation occurs gradually, with kernels near the tip of the ear developing
this layer earlier than kernels near the base of the
ear. Grain moisture at this time ranges between
25 and 35 percent.
It is obvious now that being able to identify the
growth stage of a particular field can help in making
replanting decisions, and in scheduling fertilization,
irrigation, pest management and harvesting operations in a timely fashion to achieve maximum yields.

2 - Cultural Practices

Jeremy Ross, Gary Huitink and Phil Tacker
Land Selection
Corn performs best on deep, well-drained,
medium to coarse textured soils, but producers have
successfully produced corn on a wide range of soil
types. High rainfall amounts are common in the
spring and early summer when the root system of
corn is developing. Perhaps the most important
consideration for land selection is drainage. Corn
production will be limited if drainage is inadequate.
No-tillage can be a high-yield method of planting
corn if the land is well-drained. Drainage should be
corrected or improved prior to planting to increase
corn yield potential. In most years, drainage and
timely irrigation are the primary factors determining
the yield potential of well-managed corn in Arkansas.
Seedbed Preparation
Preparing raised beds and planting into a
freshly-tilled seedbed is currently the most common
practice in Arkansas, but planting “flat” is practiced.
Planting no-till into beds from the previous crop may
be cost-effective. Most farmers are satisfied with
beds that are formed from fall to early in the spring,
where rainfall has settled and “firmed” the bed.
The advantages of planting on a bed versus flat
include: (a) beds normally warm more quickly in
the early spring, thus allowing for earlier planting;
(b) beds provide drainage following heavy rainfall;
and (c) in a dry spring, the top of the bed can be
knocked down in order to plant into moisture.
Planting no-till corn can be successful if the
seedbed is not rutted from the previous harvest
operation or washed out from heavy rainfall. A
burndown herbicide to kill existing weeds is necessary, but little else is required to get a stand. Timing
may be more vital with no-tillage; otherwise, the
management of no-tillage varies little from conventional planting. Shredding stalks or a light disking
complicate no-tillage planting. An undisturbed
seedbed provides a firm surface for cutting through
residue and obtaining a more uniform seeding depth.
Subsoiling compacted soils is needed to raise
corn yield potential. Where shallow hardpans exist,
a ripper-hipper, may penetrate through the root- and
moisture-restricting layer. A high-residue ripperhipper can be used to subsoil under the future row
as the beds are formed in the fall. The ripper-hipper
has a heavy draft, high horsepower requirement. A
good approach is to use a 4- or 6-row ripper-hipper
and examine several field locations to assure that
the shanks are penetrating the hard soil layer. To be
compatible with the number of rows on his planter
and combine header, a grower follows by bedding
on these rows again with an 8- or l2-row bedder.
Several GPS-guided controls (for example, the John
Deere AutoTrac™ assisted steering system) may
provide a sufficiently accurate row spacing to make
a second bedding pass unnecessary.
Some growers use high-residue subsoilers in the
fall at an angle to the anticipated rows to eliminate
deeper compaction. The advantages of a highresidue subsoiler is that preparatory tillage after the
last season’s crop is unnecessary because coulters
cut the residue, and less tillage is required to prepare
the beds after subsoiling.
Planting Precision
Uneven plant spacing and emergence may
reduce corn yield potential. Seed should be spaced
as uniformly as possible within the row to ensure
maximum yields, regardless of plant population and
planting date.

Figure 2-1. Relationship of corn yield to planting
speeds from 4 to 7 mph for selected planters
A three-state study evaluating 22 planters of
various ages in good operating condition, shows that
planting speed may affect yield, regardless of the
age of the planter, model of the planter or acres
planted per year. In addition, higher speeds modified
the seeding rate and increased the seed spacing
variability for about half of the planters evaluated.
Figure 2-1 shows how yield dropped with increased
speed for five planters. The average yield decrease
from 4 to 7 mph was approximately 10 percent for
the five planters.
For precision planting, try these four steps:
1.	 Calibrate the planter at the speed intended for
planting. Don’t risk obtaining a misleading
seeding rate from slow speeds.
2.	 Calibrate on a hard turnrow to be able to locate
all the seed and assure that the rate is approximately correct before taking the planter to the
field. (If a seed monitor displays population per
acre, verify that the monitor is displaying values
that coincide with actual seed counts behind the
planter. Multiple seeds don’t trigger a response
if they pass the sensor together. Seed monitors
are helpful to warn you about skips, malfunctioning rows or undesirable seeding rates.
However, they will not detect erratic spacing
between seeds.)
3.	 Check behind the planter in the field to verify
that seed placement, depth, and spacing are
exactly what you intend. Once seed is planted,
it is hard to be sure that you’ve found all the
seed. Roughly prepared ground bounces the
planter units and may shift seeding rates either
up or down.
4.	 Check the planting rate every time you change
seed size or hybrid. These changes as well as
seed treatments or field roughness, may cause
multiple seed drops or skips.
Vacuum seed selection planters typically
achieve the most uniform plant densities followed
by plateless or finger pickup seed selection. With
all other factors equal, maximum yields occur
when corn is placed uniformly deep into the soil
with uniform spacing between seeds. Producers
should follow the manufacturer’s recommended
planting speeds.
Most research in the mid-south region indicates
the greatest yields are obtained in row spacings of
30 inches. Row spacings less than 30 inches are
typically too narrow to pull up a sufficient bedded
row for surface drainage. Experiments have generally
shown little yield advantage for row spacings less
than 30 inches.
Many mid-south evaluations indicate that 38-inch
rows incur a 10 to 15 percent yield reduction compared to 30-inch row spacings. The yield reduction
in wider rows may be due primarily to sun light
reaching the soil surface; thus less total utilization
of solar energy for grain production. Additionally,
wider rows may fail to shade the soil, and result in
more evaporative moisture loss. This can increase
the irrigation cost or potentially reduce yield in dry
seasons. Wide rows may also result in more lodging,
especially with complications from charcoal rot or
midseason windstorms since there is somewhat less
mutual plant support with wider row spacings.
Planting Date
Corn growth and development responds
primarily to temperature and is not controlled by
day length. Thus, the calendar date is not as important as soil temperature and air temperature when
considering when to plant corn. Good germination
and emergence are expected when the soil temperature at a 2-inch depth is 55˚F by 9:00 a.m. for three
consecutive days. This normally occurs in late
March in south Arkansas and early April in north
Arkansas. Frost may occur after these planting dates
in some years, but corn typically withstands frost
with little economic injury. Early frosts may remove
8 
a single emerged leaf, but a leaf will emerge from
the seed. Severe frosts later in corn development
can be destructive, but these conditions are very rare
in Arkansas.
Early plantings typically yield more than late
plantings and there are other possible advantages to
early planting dates, including:
•	 Less conflict with other crop operations (cotton,
soybeans, rice and wheat), including drying grain
•	 Fewer irrigations
•	 Reduced insect and virus damage
• 	Earlier harvest
Seed should be planted 1 1/2 and 2 inches deep
into moist soil. If moisture is deeper than 3 inches,
it is advisable to wait until after a rain before
planting. If center pivot irrigation is available, it
may be used prior to planting to obtain the soil
moisture desired.
Seeding Rate and Plant Populations
The desired final plant population depends on
the hybrid, whether the field is irrigated and reasonable yield expectations. The recommended plant
populations range from 16,000 to 32,000 plants per
acre. Recommended population for dryland
production ranges from 16,000 to 24,000 plants per
acre whereas irrigated corn has greater yield potential
from 26,000 to 32,000 plants per acre. Most seed
companies recommend a specific planting range for
each hybrid. They suggest the lower end of the
range if the field is not irrigated and the yield potential is less than 160 bushels per acre. Where higher
yield potential exists and corn is well-irrigated, the
higher end of the range is recommended.
Most seeding densities are based on “ear flex.”
Full ear flex hybrids can compensate for fewer
plants per acre because the ear grows both in length
and girth. These hybrids usually produce only one
ear per stalk. Individual semi-flex hybrid ears will
not compensate to the extent that full flex hybrids
will, but with low stand density and excellent growing conditions they may set two or more ears. Few
of the modern corn hybrids released today are
“fixed” ear. Fixed ear hybrids must obtain the
desired population for maximum yields.

seed size, and several other factors can affect the
seeding rate. Furrow counts should be done several
times during planting, especially where a planter is
prone to bounce. Initially it is advisable that each
row be checked, since row units may fail to plant at
the same rate. If each row has a separate seed box,
monitoring the fill levels will help to detect planter
unit skips. However, a good seed monitor is highly
recommended to detect seeding failures immediately.
The corresponding number in Table 2-1 should
closely estimate the planting rate of corn on a
particular row spacing.
Table 2-2 shows the number of plants required
per 10 row feet to determine the final plant stand on
several different row widths. Several locations within
a field should be checked to give a good representation of the entire field. Table 2-2 gives a good
estimate of the final plant population or stand.
Hybrid Selection
Hybrid selection is one of the important decisions
a producer will make. Yield is an important factor
but maturity, stay green, lodging, shuck cover, ear
placement, disease and insect resistance play a role
in hybrid selection. In Arkansas, 112 to 120 day
maturity hybrids usually produce the highest yields.
Producers with a relatively large amount of rice may
use 108 to 110 day hybrids, and sacrifice a few
bushels of corn so they can pick corn prior to rice
harvest. Hybrids that stay green later into their
maturity usually retain better stalk strength and have
less lodging potential. Shuck cover is important
since good ear coverage reduces the introduction of
soil fungi, thus less potential for kernel damage. Ear
placement can be very important in corn planted
later in the season.
Most corn hybrids will grow taller as day length
increases due to increased day and night temperatures.
Rapid growth results in more space between nodes,
thus ear placement can be substantially different
within the same hybrid planted at different times.
Usually, the higher the ear placement, the greater
the lodging potential. If possible, select late-planted
hybrids that have lower ear placement. Biotechnology
advances have resulted in corn hybrids that are
resistant to insects due to toxins produced in the
plant tissue. There are also some hybrids that are
herbicide resistant. A few hybrids contain both of
these traits and are referred to as “stacked” trait
hybrids. Selecting hybrids and managing them to
utilize genetic strengths are addressed in the weed
and insect control sections.
10 
Growing Degree Days
Yield potential and maturity are important when
selecting a hybrid that will produce mature, sound
grain during a normal growing season for a particular
region in Arkansas. Relative maturity among
hybrids is best evaluated by grain moisture content
in performance reports.
The number of days that are required for a
hybrid to reach maturity depends on location, date
of planting, and the weather during the growing
season. A hybrid that is labeled as a 115-day hybrid
may take 110 to 120 days to mature depending on
the above factors. This system of measuring corn
maturity does not take into account the complicated
physiological processes that control growth and
development of corn.
Growing degree days (GDD) are a daily
accumulation of heat for crop growth. A hybrid’s
GDD rating is determined from planting to black
layer formation (physiological maturity). Most seed
corn suppliers include a GDD rating on their seed
tags or in their hybrid descriptions. Corn does not
grow when temperatures are below 50°F and
temperatures above 86°F do not increase plant
growth rate. Therefore, 50°F is set as the minimum
temperature and 86°F is set as the maximum
temperature for calculating GDD.
The formula for calculating growing degree
days is to add the daily high temperature (86°F
maximum) and daily low temperature (50°F minimum), divide the result by 2 and then subtract 50.
The answer represents the heat units for one day.
GDD = [(daily high + daily low) ÷ 2] – 50
Example 1:
83°F (daily high temp); 63°F (daily low temp)
83 (daily high) + 63 (daily low) = 146
146 ÷ 2 = 73
73 - 50 = 23 GDD
Example 2:
95°F (daily high temp); 70°F (daily low temp)
Since the daily high temperature is greater than
86°F, 86°F will be used as the daily high
temperature.
86 (daily high) + 70 (daily low) = 156
156 ÷ 2 = 78
78 - 50 = 28 GDD
Producers can use a thermometer that reads both
maximum and minimum temperatures to calculate
and record GDD for their crop.

3 - Drainage and Irrigation

Phil Tacker, Earl Vories and Gary Huitink
Drainage
Adequate drainage is necessary for maximum
corn production. It is highly recommended that corn
be planted on raised rows or beds, especially on
fields that are relatively flat. Corn is typically
planted early when low temperatures and significant
rainfall are likely. Raised rows or beds reduce the
effect that cold, wet soil conditions have on planting
and early crop development. Rolling fields that have
significant slopes may not need raised rows or beds
for drainage, but may still benefit from the beds
warming up faster than flat seed beds. Poor drainage
hampers field operations from field preparation
through harvest and limits the effectiveness of
irrigation. Eliminating poorly drained areas
preserves natural soil productivity by reducing field
rutting that requires additional tillage. Poorly
drained areas reduce yields and often require the
most tillage. Water infiltration is also reduced if soil
is tilled when it is too wet. Good field drainage
complements all crop production practices and
makes it possible to consider reduced or no-till corn
production. The goal for drainage is to have
minimal standing water on a field 24 hours after
a rainfall or irrigation.
Surface Drainage
Field surface smoothing and forming, prior to
bedding, can improve the surface drainage of a
field. Use land planes to smooth out the high spots
and fill in the low areas so that the field has a more
uniform slope toward drainage outlets. Low areas
that are larger than 100 feet across or that require
more than 6 inches of fill should be overfilled and
compacted before being planed. Make an effort to
accurately determine a field’s drainage flow pattern.
Deciding where water will drain by simply looking
at the field is not always easy. Some limited surveying of field elevations can be very helpful in
determining where to place tail water furrows and
field drain outlets.
Precision grading of a field provides a positive
method of improving surface drainage as well as
making furrow irrigation possible. If a field is being
considered for precision grading, the soil should be
evaluated to determine what problems might occur
if deep cuts are made in some areas. The cut areas
may expose soil with reduced production capability.
County soil survey reports, published by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS, formerly
SCS), can help identify soils with unproductive
subsoils. Taking several deep (more than 6 inch
depth) soil cores or samples may be beneficial if a
problem soil is suspected. Poultry litter application
may improve the productivity of cut soils. An
Extension publication, Soil and Fertilizer Information Article 2-90, Poultry Litter as an Amendment
for Precision Graded Soils, reports on results of
litter application studies.
Precision grading is limited to fields with slopes
of less than 1 percent, or the cost can be prohibitive.
If possible, the finished grade in the primary
slope direction should range from 0.1 to 0.5 percent (% 0.1 to 0.5 ft. per 100 ft.). This range provides good surface drainage without increasing erosion potential. Slopes of less than 0.1 percent are
suitable for cross slopes but should be limited to
slope lengths of a quarter mile or less. Slopes less
than 0.1 percent are more difficult to construct with
precision, and they tend to develop more low areas
and reverse grades. It is also recommended to
consider putting a field to grade in only one direction (i.e., zero cross slope) if it doesn’t require a
significant amount of extra cost. Building a permanent pad or elevated road on one or more sides of a
13 
field should also be considered in the grading plan.
Settling often occurs in deeper fill areas and should
be “touched up” before bedding if possible. The
land grading design should consider the type of
drain outlets and the number required for the field.
If possible, it is best to provide an outlet point for
every 20 acres.
An elevation survey of the field is required
before any design work can be done. Survey
information can be entered into a computer program
that evaluates possible drainage options for a field
and determines the cuts and fills required. Most land
grading contractors offer the computer program
design, and it is sometimes available through
NRCS. The lowest expected elevation of the field
should be determined before grading begins to
assure that water will drain into the surrounding
ditches adequately and not back up onto the field. It
may be necessary to divide the field into shorter
segments to ensure that the runoff leaves the field.
Precision grading is usually expensive and is a
long-term investment for increasing production
efficiency and potential and the market value of the
land. Government funded conservation programs
sometimes offer cost sharing on precision grading
and/or other conservation best management
practices. Information on these programs can be
obtained through NRCS.
Good surface drainage is even more important if
corn is planted flat rather than on raised rows or
beds. Low areas in a flat-planted field are likely to
have poor production for obvious reasons. Drain
furrows to these areas can be used to reduce the
effect on the crop. Shallow and narrow drain
furrows can be constructed with several different
types of equipment. The equipment should spread
the soil evenly away from the drain furrow, so flow
into the furrow is not restricted. Construct drain
furrows in the low areas of a field rather than
putting them in randomly. They should generally
run with or at a slight angle to the natural slope of
the field but not across the direction of the slope.
Furrows should have continuous positive grade to
assure that the water will be directed off the field.
A drain furrow is not complete until it is connected
to a ditch or pipe of adequate size to carry excess
water away from the field.
An important component of field drainage is the
ditch system that receives the excess water and
carries it away from the field. Flow restrictions in
these ditches can cause excess water to remain on a
field. Drainage ditches should be maintained and
routinely cleaned out to effectively handle the
drainage water from a field. No tillage or reducing
tillage limits the sediment leaving fields and
minimizes the sedimentation that occurs in
drainage ditches. Ditch outlets and drainage
structures should also be checked to assure that they
are functioning properly and are not becoming
restricted. Beavers often cause problems by
damming ditches, culverts and drainage pipes. A
Beaver Pond Leveler pipe has the potential to
reduce these problems in certain situations. This
device is described in Extension publication
FSA-9068, Flood Water Management With a Beaver
Pond Leveler. It may be necessary to work with
neighboring farms and/or the Drainage District to
correct common drainage problems. Planned
drainage improvements could impact areas classified as wetlands. If this possibility exists, contact
the local NRCS staff to see what help they can
provide. Typically, they can visit the site and
determine if there are drainage restrictions.
Internal Drainage
Many Arkansas soils, with the exception of the
sandier (coarse) soils, have limited infiltration
and/or internal drainage. Some clean-tilled silty
soils tend to seal or crust over at the surface after
rainfall or irrigation, restricting the movement of
water into the soil surface and the root zone.
Infiltration may be improved through crop residue
management. Maintaining crop residue reduces
surface sealing and crusting so water moves into the
soil more freely. This improves the infiltration and
water-holding capacity of the soil.
Naturally occurring restrictive soil layers and
those formed by tillage equipment restrict internal
soil drainage. The restrictive soil layers reduce the
rooting depth and water reservoir available to the
corn plant. Shattering these layers prior to planting a
corn crop is recommended to improve plant root
development and internal drainage. A soil probe or
shovel can be used in several areas of a field to
determine if restrictive soil layers are a problem.
14 
Digging up root systems and observing the rooting
depth and pattern can also help determine if there is
a restriction. Restrictive soil layers are commonly
shattered by using a subsoiler or ripper-hipper in the
field. The depth and thickness of the restrictive layer
usually determines which implement should be
used. The restrictive layer must be dry enough
for the deep tillage implement to extend just
below the bottom of the restrictive layer so it is
effectively lifted and shattered. If the restrictive
layer begins at 8 inches and is 2 to 3 inches thick,
the tillage shank must penetrate 10 to 12 inches
deep. In-row subsoiling is more effective than random subsoiling paths due to the re-compaction caused
by subsequent trips of the implement. The in-row
pattern also reduces the likelihood the field will be
too soft in the spring to support equipment and
delay early field preparations. High-residue
subsoilers or ripper-hippers are suggested for maintaining the same row location year to year. Surface
tillage, especially disking, quickly reforms
restrictive layers and should be avoided, if possible.
Irrigation
Corn production in Arkansas is only
recommended with irrigation. All five locations for
the Arkansas Corn Hybrid Performance Tests are
irrigated, even though there is still a small percentage (estimated 20 percent or less) of corn in
Arkansas that is not irrigated. Reasonable corn
yields may be obtained without irrigation in some
years that have good rainfall patterns and growing
conditions. However, if adequate rainfall does not
occur, yields can be a disaster and the drought stress
can contribute to charcoal rot and aflatoxin, which
can result in crop failure. These potential risks are
the basis for the strong recommendation to irrigate
corn in Arkansas.
Yield
Several hybrids in the Arkansas Corn Performance
Tests have 2- and 3-year irrigated average yields of
175 bushels per acre or greater. In the 3 years
(2000-2002) of the Corn Research Verification
Program, the average yield for the 26 irrigated fields
was 175 bushels per acre. Most Arkansas corn
producers report irrigated yields of 150 to
200 bushels per acre, and many experienced corn
growers are consistently harvesting 175 to
200 bushels per acre on much of their acreage.
Irrigated corn should yield approximately
175 bushels per acre with good production
practices and management on productive soils.
Water Needs
The total amount of water that a corn crop needs
during the growing season may vary from 20 to
30 inches depending on factors such as weather
conditions, plant density, fertility, soil type and days
to maturity. In most seasons, the amount of water
needed will be about 20 to 24 inches. The inches of
irrigation water required will vary depending on the
beginning soil moisture and the rainfall received
during the growing season. The irrigation system
needs to be capable of providing 12 to 16 inches of
irrigation water to assure a good yield potential.
Moisture stress anytime after planting can affect
plant development and reduce yield potential. The
amount of yield loss is dependent on the growth
stage of the corn when moisture stress occurs.
Table 3-1 shows the general relationship of potential
yield reduction due to moisture stress at different
growth stages.
Table 3-1. Potential Yield Reduction From
Moisture Stress at Different Growth Stages
of Corn
Growth Stage % Yield Reduction
Prior to tasseling 10-20
Tasseling to soft dough 20-60
Soft dough to maturity 10-35
Corn’s daily water needs are relatively low in
the first 3 to 4 weeks of vegetative growth, and
rainfall is usually adequate to meet the water
demand during this period. However, if it is relatively
dry when the crop emerges and rainfall doesn’t
occur in the first 2 to 3 weeks, irrigation may be
needed. When the corn has approximately 8 fully
developed leaves, its growth rate greatly increases.
The number of kernel rows per ear is determined at
this time so plant stress needs to be avoided during
this period. A sidedress fertilizer application is
usually made prior to this time. The plant’s nutrient
15 
and water uptake increases, and irrigation is often
needed at this time to activate the fertilizer and
avoid moisture stress.
If nutrient and water needs are met, rapid plant
growth continues. The number of kernels on each
ear and the size of the ear are being determined
when the plant has 12 leaves. The number of kernels
is determined by the 17-leaf stage, which is about
one week from silking. At this time the crop is very
near the start of the reproductive growth stage, when
its water needs are greatest. During the period
from about 2 weeks prior to silking until 2 to
3 weeks after silking, the water use on days with
temperatures in the upper 90s can be 0.3 inches.
This 4 to 5 week period is the most critical time
to make sure irrigation is applied as needed to
satisfy the water needs. Moisture stress during the
silking stage may delay development so that the
pollen is shed before the silks emerge. This can
result in poor or no pollination and extremely low
yields. Most corn producers report that if it is hot
and dry and you are late starting irrigation going
into this period, it is very difficult to irrigate often
enough to keep up with the crop’s water needs.
Once the grain is developed, the water use begins to
decrease because the kernels start to progressively
harden as they dry and the crop approaches maturity. Table 3-2 shows the estimated range for daily
crop water use as the crop develops.

Irrigation Scheduling
The timing of irrigation is commonly referred to
as irrigation scheduling. Correct timing is critical to
maximizing yield. Having the ability to irrigate is
important, but it is also essential that a grower
have the ability and commitment to apply
irrigation in a timely manner. Too often, growers
irrigate by the appearance of the crop. Visual stress,
especially during reproductive growth, results in
yield loss. Even if irrigation is started at the first
sign of visual stress, there is still some amount of
time required to finish irrigating a field. The result
is that the crop in the last area of the field to be
irrigated suffers even greater yield-limiting stress.
Irrigation timing decisions can be improved if
the soil moisture can be determined. Determining
the soil moisture by visual observation or by kicking
the soil surface is difficult and can be misleading.
The “feel” method can be used to determine the soil
moisture condition more accurately. This method
involves using a shovel or soil probe to pull a soil
sample from the root area. In general, if the soil
forms a hand-rolled ball, the soil moisture is
adequate. A key to this method is to take samples
across the field at different depths in order to better
determine the soil moisture for the field. The
challenge is to determine when to begin irrigation so
the entire field can be irrigated before any part
becomes too dry. Satisfactory results with the “feel”
method can be achieved with experience.
Soil moisture can be determined more precisely
with tensiometers. A tensiometer is a sealed, waterfilled tube with a vacuum gauge on the upper end
and a porous ceramic tip on the lower end. The
tensiometer is installed in the seedbed at a depth
where the majority of the roots are located. A
12-inch depth is commonly used for surface irrigation, but if a hardpan exists then the tensiometer is
placed just above the restrictive layer. Shallower
settings at about 8 inches deep are recommended for
center pivots. Two or three tensiometers per field
are recommended to avoid a problem should one of
the tensiometers quit working. Starting irrigation at
a vacuum gauge reading of about 50 centibars on
silt loam and clay soils, and at approximately
40 centibars on sandier soils, is recommended. In
addition to tensiometers, there are other soil
measurement devices that are fairly reliable and
effective when checked and maintained properly.
However, the time and effort that this requires
usually results in most producers not being able to
use them very effectively.
16 
Soil moisture accounting is used to calculate the
soil-water balance in the root zone throughout the
growing season. This method is sometimes called
checkbook irrigation scheduling because a record is
kept on the water that enters and leaves the soil like
an account balance is maintained in a checkbook.
Two forms of the checkbook procedure are
available – the Checkbook User’s Guide and the
Irrigation Scheduling computer program. The
Checkbook User’s Guide is used to keep a written
record of the soil moisture balance when a computer
is not available. It is a three-page handout that
shows how to use a water usage chart and a water
balance table to monitor the soil moisture. The
water usage chart shows an estimate of how much
water the crop uses each day based on the maximum
temperature and the age of the crop. Daily water use
and rainfall amounts are entered into a water balance table. Maximum temperature data can be taken
from the weather, newspaper, etc., but the rainfall
should be measured with a gauge at each field.
Adding and subtracting these numbers in the table
determines the soil moisture deficit. Table 3-3
shows the recommended allowable deficits that are
included in the User’s Guide to help determine
when to irrigate.

The Checkbook User’s Guide, water usage
charts and water balance tables are available
through your county Extension office at no cost.
This method does require some record keeping, but
it can be helpful in deciding when to irrigate.
If a computer is available, the Irrigation
Scheduling computer program can be used for the
record keeping. This program operates much like
the Checkbook method just described except that
the computer does the calculations. It uses daily
maximum temperatures and rainfall measurements
at the field to determine the field’s soil moisture
deficit. The program also has the option to
predict when irrigation will be needed in the next
10 days if no rainfall occurs. This offers a real
benefit to managing irrigation labor and sharing
irrigation water with other crops. The program is
used in research and Extension irrigation studies and
demonstrations conducted in Arkansas. Growers in
Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee,
Kentucky and Missouri are successfully using the
program on their farms. The program is downloadable from the following Extension web page
address: http://www. aragriculture.org/computer/
schedule/default.asp.
Irrigation Termination
As the crop approaches physiological maturity,
a decision on when to stop irrigating has to be
made. The goal is to maintain adequate soil
moisture until the corn reaches black layer,
which indicates physiological maturity. This
ensures that the kernels can obtain their maximum
weight so the crop’s full yield potential will be
achieved. The decision is best made toward the end
of the season by a field determination of the
maturity of the crop and the soil moisture status. An
initial consideration is how many days it has been
since planting. If it has been 90 days since planting
and the corn is a 112-day corn, then it may be
within 3 weeks of maturity and a field check should
be made.
Determining how developed the starch is in the
kernel is helpful in making the decision on when to
terminate irrigation. The starch begins forming as a
line from the top of the kernel and moves toward
the tip of the kernel where it is attached to the cob.
The progress of the starch line can be checked by
taking approximately six (6) representative ears
from the field and removing the shucks. The ears
can then be broken in half and some of the kernels
taken from where the ear was broken. These kernels
can be sliced lengthwise so the starch development
17 
can be observed. The goal is to determine if there is
at least 50 percent starch development inside the
kernels sampled. If there is 50 percent starch and
good soil moisture exists from a recent surface
irrigation or rain, then irrigation can be terminated.
However, if the soil is becoming dry at this point,
then additional irrigation is needed to assure
maximum seed weight and yield. A final irrigation
at this stage should be as quick a flush as possible
with flood (levee) or border irrigation. If the corn is
irrigated with a center pivot, then it is recommended
that the starch development be at 75 percent with
good soil moisture before stopping irrigation.
Irrigation Methods
The surface and sprinkler irrigation methods
used on corn have different characteristics that
determine which would be the best for a particular
situation. No one method can be labeled as the
best – each has its place.
Flood (Levee) Irrigation
Flood irrigation with levees should really be
thought of as flush irrigation. The challenge is to get
the water across the field as quickly as possible.
This is especially important if the corn is small and
planted flat rather than on a raised row or bed. It is
also critical that irrigation is started before the
crop experiences drought stress. If plants are
drought stressed and then subjected to an
extended wet soil condition, plant development
can be delayed and some plants may die.
Levees should be marked early to strengthen the
commitment to pull levees and irrigate when needed.
If the corn in the levee mark has been allowed to
grow very much, it may be necessary to bush-hog
the levees before they are pulled. This helps avoid
problems caused by having too much plant material
in the levee. Spacing of the levees depends on the
field slope, but spacing on an elevation difference of
0.3 to 0.4 feet between levees is common. A
narrower spacing of 0.2 to 0.3 feet elevation
difference may be necessary on very flat fields or
when trying to irrigate flat planted corn that is less
than 6 inches tall. Levees are usually broken in
several places or completely knocked down to get
the water into the next bay. Rebuilding the levee in
time for the next irrigation is often difficult because
the levee area tends to stay wet. Some growers
install gates or spills in the levees to avoid irrigation
delays due to rebuilding the levees between
irrigations. When possible, it is recommended that a
few gates or spills be installed in the outside levee
to provide better field drainage when a big rain
occurs during or soon after the irrigation. The
outside spills can be opened to avoid the “blowing
out” of levees.
It is recommended that water not be allowed
to stand on any area for longer than two days.
This can be difficult on big flat fields. Some growers
are able to divide a big field into two smaller fields
so they can better manage the water when they start
irrigating. If this isn’t practical, then providing
multiple water inlets to the field can be helpful.
Multiple inlets help avoid running water too long at
the top of the field in order to get water to the
bottom of the field. One multiple inlet method is to
water the upper half of the field from the pump
discharge or riser and then run irrigation pipe or
tubing from the discharge down the field to water
the lower half. A canal or flume ditch alongside the
field can also be used for multiple inlets. The water
can be directed from the ditch through cuts or spills
into individual bays down the length of the field.
Another possibility is to run tubing the full
length of the field and install several of the 2.5-inch
plastic gates in each bay. These slide gates are
adjustable from completely closed to fully open.
When fully opened they deliver 65 to 75 gallons per
minute (gpm) and they are reusable from year to
year. The decision can then be made on how many
bays to water at one time based on the available
flow and the size of the bays. This method can be
used by laying the tubing on a permanent outside
levee or road along-side a field. However, with this
installation, all of the water will tend to go to the
low end of the tubing. When this occurs, some type
of restriction has to be put on or under the tubing
(choke-rope, barrel, etc.) in order to hold water back
up the slope. Another option is to run the tubing
over the levees. Heavier tubing (9 to 10 mil) has
been laid over levees successfully as long as it is
going down slope. The 9 to 10 mil grade tubing is
better than the 6 to 7 mil in multiple-inlet-type
applications.
18 
Levee irrigation becomes even more of a
challenge if the soil is allowed to crack severely
before irrigation is started. Multiple inlets can help
offset this challenge, but it is still important to
irrigate on time. Planting on a raised bed or row as
recommended provides improved drainage and
helps avoid some of the water management
challenges of levee irrigation. Planting on beds and
using multiple inlets with spills installed in the
levees may provide the best water management
capability with flood (levee) irrigation.
A minimum irrigation capacity of 15 gpm
per irrigated acre is recommended for levee
irrigation. At this rate, about four days would be
required to complete an irrigation. Starting late
would increase the time required, resulting in severe
drought stresses in the last portion of the field to get
water. Opportunities for getting more pumping
capacity to a field should be explored and developed
whenever possible so the pumping time required to
irrigate a field can be reduced. Although levee
irrigation presents a challenge, it can be done
successfully. There are many producers who
consistently produce high yields by paying close
attention to the precautions and recommendations
that have been presented.
Furrow Irrigation
Furrow irrigation can be a very effective
irrigation method. One of the biggest requirements
for furrow irrigation is that the field must have a
positive and continuous row grade. This usually
requires precision land grading, which can be rather
expensive. However, the grading results in positive
field drainage that greatly enhances production. As
discussed earlier, the row grade should be in the
range of 0.1 to 0.5 percent, and row grades between
0.15 and 0.3 percent are especially desirable for
furrow irrigation. The row length to be furrow
irrigated is another key consideration. Row lengths
of 1,500 feet or less generally water more effectively
than longer rows. Row lengths less than 1/4 mile are
usually required if sandy soils are to be irrigated
effectively.
When row lengths cannot be altered, it may be
necessary to control the furrow stream flow by
adjusting the number of rows that are irrigated at
one time. Experience shows that in most situations
it is desirable to get the water to the end of the row
in about 12 hours. Watering so long that the top of
the row is over-watered can cause problems in this
area, especially if it rains and stays cloudy soon
after the irrigation. This is a concern with the
expanded use of irrigation tubing with punched
holes for furrow irrigation. The tendency is to punch
holes in the tubing as long as water still comes out
of them without much concern for how long it will
take to water out the row.
Growers find that on some fields with good
beds, they can use small holes with small furrow
streams for up to 24 hours on a furrow irrigation set
without risk of over-watering or damaging the crop.
This is desirable from the standpoint of operating
the tubing in sets without having to plug and open
holes. The caution is to water according to what is
more effective for the field and crop rather than
what is easiest.
Another approach that can limit or avoid the
opening and plugging of holes and the tendency to
irrigate for too long is to run parallel tubing across
the field. One run of tubing would go across the first
half of the rows and have holes punched for each
middle to be irrigated. A longer run of tubing is then
laid behind the shorter tubing. Beginning where the
shorter tubing ends, holes are punched in the longer
tubing for the middles irrigated across the remainder
of the field. This allows row sets to be changed by
unhooking one run of tubing from the irrigation well
or riser and hooking up the other run. If more than
two sets are required for a field, then alternate rows
may be irrigated to avoid the laying of additional
tubing. It is also possible to get multi-valved fittings
that can accommodate three or more sets and reduce
the amount of tubing needed to avoid the plugging
and unplugging of holes.
Furrow irrigation requires a water supply of
at least 10 gpm per irrigated acre, and more
capacity is desirable if available. At 10 gpm per
acre, about five days should be expected to
complete an irrigation. Practices like waiting until
morning to change sets when rows water out at
night can add significantly to the time, making it
difficult to finish the field before it is time to begin
19 
the next irrigation. A well-defined furrow is needed
to carry the irrigation water. Planting on a good bed
is the most desirable option for having a good water
furrow. If a bed is not used, then it is necessary to
cultivate with a furrow plow that moves enough soil
from the middle of the rows so that a good furrow is
created. Some producers prefer to water alternate
middles under certain conditions. Watering alternate
middles can result in getting across the field quicker
and not leaving the soil as saturated as it might be if
every middle were irrigated. Then, if rain comes
soon after the irrigation, it is possible for it to soak
into the soil rather than run off or collect and stand
in low spots. Producer preference and experience,
along with the crop and field condition, will determine whether it is best to water every middle or
alternate middles. Alternate middle irrigation will
usually result in having to come back with the next
irrigation somewhat sooner than when every middle
is watered.
Furrow irrigation by necessity requires that
there be some amount of tail water runoff from the
ends of the rows. All the middles will not water out
at the same rate, especially those that are wheeltrack middles. Also, cracking soils can make furrow
irrigation management more challenging. However,
irrigating on the appropriate schedule will reduce
the problems associated with extensive soil cracking.
Border Irrigation
Border irrigation may be a method to consider
on fields that are planted flat rather than on raised
beds or rows. Borders are raised beds or levees
constructed in the direction of the field’s slope. The
idea is to release water into the area between the
borders at the high end of the field, flushing a large
volume of water over a relatively flat field surface
in a short period of time. The borders guide the
water down the slope as a shallow sheet that spreads
out uniformly between the borders.
Border irrigation is best suited for precision
graded fields that have slope in only one direction.
All field preparations should be done with the
field’s primary slope, and planting should be with or
at a slight angle to the primary slope. Planting
across the slope tends to restrict the water flow,
especially on fields with less than 0.1 percent slope.
Fields with slope in two directions are not as well
suited to border irrigation, but it may still be possible
if the spacing between borders is relatively narrow.
The spacing between borders is dependent on
soil type, field slope, pumping capacity, field length
and field width. A clay soil that cracks is sometimes
difficult to irrigate, but with border irrigation, the
cracking actually helps as a distribution system
between the borders. This factor also makes it
possible to use borders on clay fields that have a
slight side or cross slope. The tendency on fields
with side slope is for the water to flow to the lower
side and not spread out uniformly between the
borders. The soil cracks lessen this affect because
the water will spread laterally as it follows the
cracking pattern. The border spacing on clay soil
will generally be between 200 and 300 feet with the
narrower spacing on fields with side slope.
The border spacing on sandy and silt loam soils
that tend to seal or crust over is more of a challenge
than with the cracking clays. Side slope on these
soils results in the border spacing having to be
narrower in order for the water to spread uniformly
between the borders. The border spacing on soils
that seal or crust over will generally range between
100 and 200 feet with the narrower spacing on
fields that have side slopes.
The pumping capacity and field dimensions
(length and width) are used to determine the number
of borders needed and how many can be irrigated in
a reasonable time. The desired pumping capacity
for border irrigation is 12 gpm per irrigated
acre. Calculations can be made to estimate the
time required to irrigate a border, and it is
usually possible to work toward approximately
12 hour set times, which fit very well for
managing water and labor.
The border can be constructed in a variety of
ways and with different types of equipment. It is
also possible to plant on the borders if they are
constructed before planting. A settled border height
of 2 to 3 inches is all that is needed on ideal fields
with no side slope, but a 3 to 6 inch settled height is
required if the field has side slope or if the field has
shallow depressions or potholes. If the border is
constructed with a disk type implement, an effort
20 
must be made to fill the ditch left at the base of
the border so it will not act as a drain furrow.
The borders need to stop at least 30 feet from the
low end of the field so they will not restrict
drainage. The water can be delivered into the area
between the borders from a canal, gated pipe or
irrigation tubing. The 2.5-inch plastic gates that
deliver 65 to 75 gpm each can be installed in the
tubing so sets can be changed by opening and
closing the gates. If gates are installed in the
irrigation tubing, the heavier 9 to 10 mil tubing
should be used. When holes are punched in the
tubing, the parallel tubing layout discussed with
furrow irrigation may need to be used in order to
avoid plugging and unplugging holes.
If border irrigation can be used on a field that is
usually flood irrigated, then it can provide certain
advantages:
1.	 less production area lost with borders than with
levees,
2.	 improved ability to irrigate small corn,
3.	 don’t have to repair or rebuild border between
irrigations, thus a potential for time and labor
savings,
4.	 field drainage is not restricted by borders and
5.	 possibility of planting on the borders.
Border irrigation will not work on all fields,
and it should really only be considered when the
corn is planted flat. There is not adequate space in
this publication to cover all of the details associated
with border irrigation. However, more information
is available through your local county Extension
office.
Center Pivot Irrigation
Center pivots offer the ability to irrigate fields
that have surface slopes that make it impossible or
impractical to irrigate with surface methods. They
also offer more water management options than
surface irrigation. The need for good surface
drainage still exists with pivot irrigation and
should not be overlooked.
Pivots are best suited for large square-,
rectangular- or circular-shaped fields free of
obstacles such as trees, fences, roads, power poles,
etc. Field ditches are also a concern if the pivot
towers must cross them. Pivots can cover a range of
acreage depending on the allowable length, but the
common 1/4-mile, full circle system will cover
approximately 130 acres of a 160-acre square field.
It is possible to tow a pivot from one field to
another, but it is usually best for a system not to
be towed between more than two points during
the season.
Pivots provide the ability to control the
irrigation amount applied by adjusting the system’s
speed. This gives the operator advantages for
activating chemicals, watering up a crop and
watering small plants. It is also possible to apply
liquid fertilizer and certain pesticides through the
system. This is called chemigation, and it can be
especially applicable to corn for sidedress or lateseason applications of fertilizer. Any chemicals
that are to be applied through the system must
be specifically labeled for chemigation. The label
will give fairly specific application requirements
and recommendations if a chemical is approved for
chemigation application. Any pivot system used for
chemigation must have some specific equipment
and safety devices installed. Information on equipment requirements and chemigation is available
through most center pivot dealers or companies.
General information on chemigation can be obtained
through the local county Extension office.
It is recommended that a pivot have a water
supply of at least 5 gpm per acre that is irrigated.
At that rate, nearly four days are required to apply a
1-inch irrigation. A water supply less than this
leaves no room for break down time without the risk
of getting behind in meeting the crop water needs.
The capacity for a towable system should be greater
to account for the added time needed to move the
system. It is recommended that pivot irrigation be
applied early enough to avoid the deeper soil
moisture being extracted early in the season. If the
deeper moisture is used early in the season, it
becomes difficult for a pivot to keep up with the
water demand unless rainfall replenishes the deep
moisture. A pivot irrigation will typically soak about
8 inches of the root zone and has very little chance
of replacing moisture any deeper. The goal is to
save the deeper moisture for when irrigation is
terminated and the crop uses the deeper moisture to
take it to maturity.
21 
Most pivots are equipped with low-pressure
sprinkler packages, and many are mounted on drops
that release the water closer to the soil surface. This
is desirable as long as the system application rate is
matched to the soil and field characteristics so
excessive runoff is avoided. If a field has a rolling
surface and a soil that tends to crust or seal over,
this should be taken into account in the sprinkler
package selection. The application amount can be
adjusted to reduce runoff to some degree, and most
producers find that applying approximately 1 inch
works best. Minimum tillage that leaves crop
residue on the surface can help reduce runoff
problems. It might also be possible to put in narrow
width (1 inch or less) slots at a depth of about
8 inches in some of the middles. This can be done
with something like anhydrous shanks in order to
give the water a path for soaking in rather than
running off a sealed or crusted-over soil surface.
One of the biggest advantages of pivot irrigation
is the limited labor required for operating the
system. The biggest challenge with center pivots is
the initial cost. However, they offer some
advantages that can justify the initial cost, especially
when surface irrigation is not possible and the cost
is spread over an expected service life of at least
15 years.
When considering the different irrigation
methods, it is important to remember that any
method that is well planned and is properly
installed, operated and maintained can give the
results desired. Every method requires time to
irrigate the whole field, so it is very important
that irrigation be started early enough that no
part of the field suffers moisture stress.
Arkansas Situation
Consistent and profitable corn production in
Arkansas is difficult without irrigation. Once
irrigation is in place, the irrigation operating cost for
each irrigation is typically $3 to $6.50 per acre. This
cost is easily justified by the yield increase that can
result from the irrigation. The maximum profit
usually results when the maximum yield is obtained,
so the irrigation goal is to obtain the maximum yield
by preventing crop moisture stress. Irrigation is
not a cure-all. Maximum yield and profit will be
achieved only when irrigation is coupled with
other production practices that establish
profitable yield potentials.

4 - Fertilization and Liming

Leo Espinoza and Jeremy Ross
Soil testing is the foundation of a sound fertility
program, with the goal of a soil testing program
being to provide guidelines for the efficient use of
lime and fertilizers. University of Arkansas fertilizer
and lime recommendations are based on field research
conducted under varying soil conditions, crop rotations, crop nutrient requirements and yield goals.
Soil pH
Soil pH affects the availability of nutrients to
plant roots. The desirable soil pH for corn ranges
from 5.8 to 7.0. Continued cultivation and the use
of chemical fertilizers, especially those containing
ammonium and sulfur, tends to decrease soil pH
over time. Irrigation with water high in calcium
carbonate, on the other hand, tends to increase soil pH.
Soil samples should be collected and checked
for the degree of acidity or alkalinity in a soil. Lime
is generally recommended at pH values below 5.7
(Table 4-1). If rice is in the rotation, lime is not
recommended without the benefit of additional
information such as irrigation water quality tests.
Even then, lime is not recommended unless the soil
pH is below 5.7 (Table 4-2). If lime is needed, it is
better to apply it during the fall to provide enough
time for it to react with the soil.
Liming materials also have different Relative
Neutralizing Values (RNV). The RNV of a material
is based on its fineness and Calcium Carbonate
Equivalent (CCE or the amount of pure calcium
carbonate to which the selected material
corresponds), with finer materials reacting more
quickly than coarse materials. An Ag lime material
with a CCE of 110 is “stronger” than an Ag lime
material with a CCE of 90, consequently less
volume would be needed to increase the pH of a
given soil.

Nitrogen
Nitrogen is an important component of amino
acids and proteins, which are the basic building
blocks of all living matter – both plant and animal.
Nitrogen-deficient plants normally show a
pale-yellowish color (Chlorosis), which results from
a shortage of Chlorophyll in the plant’s “solar
collection cells.” A rough rule of thumb is that,
based on the yield level, 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of actual
nitrogen (N) are required for each bushel of corn
produced. More N is normally required per bushel
on the silty clays and clays (Table 4-3) than on the
sandy loams and silt loam soils (Table 4-4).

In Arkansas, this is due to the tendency of clay
soils to fix ammonium ions between the clay
particles in an unavailable form. If high carryover N
is suspected, a soil nitrate-nitrogen test may be used
to refine recommended N rates. For a reliable
indication of N carryover, the grower should submit
at least one subsoil sample along with a topsoil
sample about a month ahead of planting. The topsoil
and subsoil samples should each represent at least
12 inches of soil depth. Total soil profile N in
excess of 40 pounds per acre should be subtracted
from the preplant rate in order to achieve a
particular yield goal.
Figure 4-1, shows a typical nutrient uptake
pattern for a corn plant. No more than half of the
total amount of the recommended N should be
applied preplant, since the root system is not yet
fully developed and salt damage to the young
seedlings is a possibility. Also, in the event of poor
stands, there remains the option of saving the
fertilizer that would have been sidedressed. The
remainder of the N should be sidedressed or
topdressed after a stand is obtained but before the
corn gets “knee high” (six leaves). At this point the
corn plant will experience a period of rapid growth,
the growing point is above the soil surface and the
plant is “deciding” what type of yield load it can
support. Thus, it is critical that the plant has an
ample supply of nutrients, and water, at this time.
Preliminary results of on-going research in Arkansas
have shown the potential for significant yield
increases when a portion of the fertilizer is applied
just before the tassel emerges.
Common N-fertilizer sources include ammonium,
nitrate and urea (Table 4-5). These are sold in dry or
in liquid formulations (with urea ammonium nitrate

having a N content of 28 to 32 percent, for
example). Ammonium has a positive charge that is
attracted to the negatively charged surface of clay
and humus and, as a result, is not as mobile as the
nitrate ion. However, under alkaline conditions N, in
the ammonia form, may be lost through volatilization.
Nitrate is the form used in the largest proportion
by most plants. Nitrates are repelled by the negative
charges of soil since nitrates possess a negative
charge as well. Nitrate thus tends to remain in
solution, subject to leaching and denitrification.
Urea is in reality an organic form of fertilizer,
which is commercially manufactured for fertilizer
purposes. Plant roots cannot use it directly, so the
nitrogen first needs to be converted to an inorganic
form (ammonium or nitrate). This conversion is
mediated by enzymes present in the soil. In cold,
wet soils, urea behaves as a slow-release fertilizer
since soil enzymes are not very active under such
conditions. Under dry soil conditions, urea is stable
for up to seven days after surface application.
Rainfall or irrigation and incorporation with
cultivation are needed to reduce potential nitrogen
losses. Urea itself is highly mobile in soils, and thus
urea-N also can be lost from the crop root zone.
Animal Manures
Animal manures and particularly poultry litter
may be used as supplements to commercial
fertilizers. Rates should be based on soil test results
and the nutrient content of the manure, keeping in
mind that only 50 to 60 percent of the nitrogen in
manure becomes plant-available the first year, and
that applying manure based solely on crop N
requirements may supply P in excess of plant needs.
Where higher rates of animal manures are used,
plant analysis should be used to monitor N needs
in order to make possible adjustments during the
growing season.
Phosphate and Potash
Phosphates have been called the “key of life”
because they play an important role in the storage
and transfer of energy within plant cells. Phosphates
react rapidly with soil constituents that reduce the
availability of this nutrient to plant roots.
Phosphates interact positively with nitrogen and
potassium, while high soil phosphate levels may
also reduce plant uptake of zinc and copper. In soils
of pH 7.0 or higher, phosphorus also binds with
calcium, forming insoluble compounds that are
largely unavailable to plant roots. Starter fertilizers
25 
may be beneficial for high pH soils and/or with rice
in the rotation, with a typical starter rate being 5 gallons per acre of 10-37-0 material.
Apply all recommended P and K at or before
planting, along with at least 30 pounds of N per
acre. Early planted corn, and corn under no-till, may
exhibit phosphorus deficiency symptoms even on
soils that have high levels of soil-test P. Where this
occurs, as little as 15 pounds per acre of P2O5
sidedressed near the row has proved effective in
overcoming these temporary P deficiency symptoms.
However, a warming period will usually allow the
corn to recover, and seldom are yields permanently
reduced by the temporary phosphorus deficiency.
Phosphorus is recommended unless soil-test P is
higher than 100 pounds per acre. Recommended
rates range from 50 to 100 pounds of P2O5 per acre,
depending on the soil test level, the soil type and the
yield goal (Tables 4-3 and 4-4).
Potash also plays a critical role in the nutritional
balance of a plant. Potash deficiency in corn results
in reduced growth, delayed maturity, lodging caused
by weak straw and low bushel weight, with visual
symptoms including leaf burning. Potash is recommended at soil test levels below 275 pounds per
acre. Recommended rates range from 50 to
200 pounds of K2O per acre, based on needs.
Potash applications greater than 90 pounds per acre
should be split to avoid salt injury.
Calcium, Magnesium and Sulfur
The secondary elements calcium, magnesium
and sulfur are generally considered adequate in most
soils. Calcium is generally adequate for corn as long
as crop lime needs (pH) are being met, but
magnesium and/or sulfur deficiencies are possible on
sandy soils low in organic matter. The University of
Arkansas Soil Testing Laboratory routinely
determines both magnesium and sulfate-sulfur.
A low level of available magnesium or sulfur in
the topsoil is difficult to interpret unless a subsoil
test is also obtained. Both elements tend to leach
downward and accumulate with the subsoil clays.
However, medium to high soil-test levels of
these elements in the topsoil should indicate
adequate levels for the corn crop. A good rule of
thumb is that soil-test sulfur levels below 20 pounds
per acre and magnesium levels below 75 pounds per
acre may be an indication of a deficiency. It is not
uncommon for well waters to contain 1 to 2 pounds
of magnesium and 2 to 6 pounds of sulfate-S per
acre-inch.
Secondary element needs are best assessed by
foliar analysis of corn leaves during the growing
season. When a soil test indicates very low levels of
magnesium (generally on very sandy soils of low
CEC), 20 to 40 pounds per acre of additional
magnesium are needed.
Dolomitic lime is the most economical source
of magnesium where lime is needed. Potassium
magnesium sulfate, commercially known as K-Mag
or Sul-Po-Mag, typically contains 23 percent potash,
23 percent sulfur and 11 percent magnesium. It has
relatively high water solubility compared to
dolomitic lime. There is also a granular 36 percent
magnesium product that contains both magnesium
sulfate and magnesium oxide.
Micronutrients
Micronutrients are needed in small amounts by
corn, but deficiencies still may occur which could
limit yields. The University of Arkansas Soil Testing
Laboratory routinely tests soils for iron, manganese,
zinc and copper. Molybdenum should not be
deficient in corn under most circumstances in
Arkansas. Iron, manganese, zinc, copper and boron
are adequate in most soils. However, low levels and
possible deficiencies of some of these could occur
on leached, sandy soils of low CEC and on
medium-textured soils that have an alkaline pH or
that have been over-limed.
Zinc is the micronutrient most likely to be
found deficient for corn. The deficiency typically
occurs at the V2 through V8 growth stages. Analysis
of plant tissue during the growing season and
comparison of these results over time against
published standards is the best way to assess micronutrient status. The University of Arkansas Diagnostic
Laboratory at Fayetteville will also analyze plant
tissue for a fee. Zinc sulfate (10 pounds Zn per acre)

is the preferred inorganic source for soil applications
since it dissolves fairly easily and should be at least
50 percent water soluble. Foliar Zn applications
should be made with chelated Zn at a rate of
1 pound Zn per acre. A 9 percent Zn solution
typically requires 1 gallon per acre of product.
Foliar Zn can be mixed with post-applied herbicides,
unless the herbicide label recommends otherwise.
Plant Analysis
Plant analysis is a more direct indicator of plant
nutrition than are soil tests. However, care must be
taken in interpreting plant analysis values because
of environmental and cultural factors that may
interfere. If a deficiency is suspected, collect whole
plant samples if the corn is less than 12 inches high,
or the uppermost mature leaf if the plant is more
than 12 inches high but before the tassel stage. If the
tassel has emerged, collect the ear leaf.
Table 4-6 shows reference sufficiency ranges for
corn grown in the southern United States. This table
may be used as a guide for all plant food elements
in leaf or whole corn plants, while keeping in mind
that collecting the appropriate plant part at the proper stage of growth is critical for the identification of
nutritional disorders. Certain elemental ratios are
also important. Ratios larger or smaller than those in
Table 4-7 suggest possible plant nutrient imbalances
or errors in testing or reporting.

5 - Major Insect Pests of Field Corn in

Arkansas and Their Management

Paul McLeod and Glen Studebaker
Field corn production in Arkansas has been
relatively minor until recent years. Because of this,
the majority of information available for managing
insects on field corn in Arkansas has been based on
data developed in the 1950s in Arkansas and on
more recent data from other states. However, with
the formation of the Arkansas Corn and Grain
Sorghum Promotion Board in 1998, funding became
available for research on field corn insects, and
substantial progress has been made. Surveys have
now been completed on insects and their impact on
field corn throughout the state. Major insect pests
have been identified, and their distribution within
the state has been established. Much has been
learned on the biology of major insect pests, and
this information has enabled the improvement of
insect management on field corn.
Although only four years of research have been
completed and numerous additional studies are
needed, substantial knowledge has been gained. The
next step in the process is to provide the corn
producers of Arkansas with this information in a
usable production manual. The objective of this
manual section is to provide the producer with the
most current information on identification, biology
and management of insect pests of field corn in
Arkansas.
Emphasis has been placed on the major insect
pests and their management. Additional insects, now
considered to be minor pests, may pose greater
threats in future years. Also, new species may
migrate into the state. Thus, continual research is
needed to identify these changes and develop
management strategies. As these findings become
available, updates to the production manual will be
made. Additional information can be found on
websites maintained by the University of Arkansas
Department of Entomology (http://comp.uark.edu/
%7Epjmcleod/) and the Cooperative Extension
Service (http://www.aragriculture.org/pestmanage
ment/insects/corn).
From a producer’s perspective, the major insect
pests of Arkansas field corn can be divided into two
groups; i.e., those attacking seed and seedlings early
in the season, and those attacking later. Early season
pests include a diverse group of insects. Among the
most damaging are chinch bugs, cutworms and
wireworms. Rootworms, a major pest of field corn
in the Midwest, have not caused significant damage
in recent years in Arkansas. The most destructive
insect pest of later season field corn in Arkansas is
the corn borer complex, including the southwestern
and European corn borers. Also, included in this
group are the corn earworm, fall armyworm and
aphids. Discussions of the major pests follow.

Chinch Bug, Blissus leucopterus
leucopterus, Heteroptera: Lygaeidae
Description
Chinch bug adults are true bugs; i.e., the front
half of the fore wing is hardened while the rear
portion is membraneous. Color is generally black,
but the light-colored wings give the appearance of a
white band across the midsection (Photo 5-1).
Adults are only about 3/16 inch long. Immatures
vary greatly in appearance. Newly hatched nymphs
appear as minute reddish/orange specs on corn
stalks and foliage. As nymphs develop, color
29 
changes from orange to dark grey or black
(Photo 5-2). All nymphs are wingless.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
In Arkansas, chinch bug population has varied
greatly during the past four years. Few were detected
during 1999 and 2000 except for Lafayette County
in extreme southwest Arkansas. Surveys during the
last two years, however, have detected chinch bugs
throughout the state. Also, very high numbers
(20 adults per three-leaf plant) have been found in
the White River Delta near Des Arc, the Arkansas
River Valley near Clarksville and Alma and near
Dumas in southeast Arkansas. Outside of Arkansas,
chinch bug occurs in all states east of the Rocky
Mountains and into southern Canada. Its impact on
field corn in more northern states is minimal. On
seedling corn, adult chinch bugs can be found either
on the ground or on stems near the ground, often
under leaf sheaths. Here they insert their stylet
mouth parts into the plant and remove plant fluids.
Infested plants often become yellow and distortion
of seedlings is common (Photo 5-3). Impact in
Arkansas from chinch bug has been substantial.
Where chinch bugs have been controlled, yields
have been increased up to 25 bushels per acre over
areas not managed.
Life History
Generally, adult chinch bugs migrate from
overwintering grasses into seedling corn. Once in
corn they mate and begin egg laying. When
orange nymphs emerge, large numbers of nymphs
can often be detected by peeling back the lower
leaves on corn seedlings. Nymphs develop for a
few weeks before becoming the winged adult form.
This process continues throughout the growing
season. Mature corn may harbor many chinch
bugs in all developmental stages. In Arkansas,
about three generations of chinch bug can develop
each season.
Management
Successful chinch bug management can be
accomplished with four approaches. First, early
planting may avoid high chinch bug populations.
Also, chinch bug damage is generally greater under
dry conditions. Plants with sufficient moisture are
more able to out grow the damage. Thus, irrigation
during periods of drought may reduce the impact of
chinch bugs on field corn. Irrigation also may aid
the uptake of insecticides applied to the seed or soil.
In areas with a history of chinch bug problems, it
may be beneficial to use seed treated with insecticide or apply a soil insecticide at planting. However,
chinch bug populations may experience great fluctuations between years, and preventative soil or seed
insecticides may not always be justified. In areas
with a history of chinch bug problems and where
treated seed or soil insecticides are used, it is
suggested that a small portion of the field be left
untreated and periodically checked for chinch bug.
The final approach to chinch bug management is
with the use of insecticide sprays applied to the
foliage of seedling corn. The chinch bug threshold is
variable and depends on the rate of plant growth and
size. Slow growing smaller plants are most susceptible to severe damage. A general threshold for
chinch bug has been established on seedlings less
than 6 inches in height. Foliar treatments should be
justified when 20 percent or more of the sampled
plants harbor a minimum of 5 chinch bugs per plant.
Fields should be sampled in several areas due to the
variability in chinch bug distribution. Because the
chinch bug is often found between the leaf sheath
and stem, spray coverage is critical. Foliar insecticides must be applied in a minimum of 20 gpa and
directed at the top of the seedling. Also, surfactants
will likely increase effectiveness.
Insecticide Recommendations for
Chinch Bug on Field Corn
See Tables 5-1 (page 41) and 5-2 (page 42) for
insecticide recommendations current at time of
publishing. Current updated recommendations can

instructions on pesticide labels.
Corn Flea Beetle, Chaetocnema
pulicaria, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae
Description
The corn flea beetle is a very small (1/16 inch
long) black beetle found on the foliage of grasses
and field corn (Photo 5-4). As the adult beetle is
approached, its common defensive behavior is to
use its enlarged hind femurs to jump; hence the
name flea beetle.
30 
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Little is known about the corn flea beetle in
Arkansas. Surveys have detected low numbers on
field corn at Marianna and Des Arc; however, it
likely occurs throughout the state. Adults damage
field corn by feeding on the epidermis of the leaf.
Damaged foliage has light-colored streaks that may
give the corn a silver appearance. In addition to
foliar damage, the corn flea beetle is capable of
transmitting Stewart’s wilt disease.
Life History
In Arkansas, the corn flea beetle adult overwinters
on grasses including weeds and grass crops like
wheat. With warm temperatures in late winter,
adults begin to feed, mate and lay eggs in the soil
near grasses and corn seedlings. Larvae develop on
roots and stems within the soil, pupate and adults
emerge to begin the process again. Multiple generations occur each year. Flea beetle problems are
greatest following mild winters.
Management
The threshold for corn flea beetle is not clearly
defined, but more than two adults per seedling
(5-leaf or smaller) may warrant foliar insecticide
application. In fields with soil-applied insecticides
at planting, it is unlikely that high numbers of flea
beetles will develop. Many of the current field corn
hybrids possess some resistance to Stewart’s wilt.

Corn Flea Beetle on Field Corn

Corn Thrips, Frankliniella spp.,
Thysanoptera: Thripidae
Description
Corn thrips are minute insects found on the leaf
surfaces of field corn. Adults are black and about
1/16 inch long (Photo 5-5). Two pairs of wings are
present and long hairs occur on the edges of the
wings. Immature thrips are smaller and lighter
in color.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Thrips occur throughout Arkansas and may be
abundant on seedling corn adjacent to maturing
wheat. Adults and immature stages “rasp” the leaf
surface with their mouthparts and feed on the
exuding plant sap. The impact of thrips on field corn
is not well documented, but large populations of
thrips can cause yellowing of foliage and stunting of
seedling field corn.
Life History
Overwintering adult thrips migrate from
maturing weeds and wheat into field corn in spring
and early summer. Mating occurs and females insert
eggs into the corn tissue. Larvae emerge and feed by
scraping the plant surface and ingesting plant sap.
Maturity is reached in less than one week and
pupation occurs in soil. Adults emerge in about four
days and the cycle is repeated. Several generations
occur annually in Arkansas.
Management
Because of the sporadic occurrence of thrips on
field corn, their impact is not fully understood and
management decisions are difficult. Foliar
insecticides directed at the top of corn seedlings and
applied in large volumes of water can be used to
reduce the number of thrips. Economic benefits of
these applications are not well established, however.
Field location may play a major role in thrips
management as large thrips populations may move
from maturing wheat into adjacent crops.

Corn Thrips on Field Corn

31 
Cutworms Including the Black Cutworm,
Agrotis ipsilon, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae
Description
Cutworm larvae are dark grey to black
caterpillars that can generally be found just below
the soil surface feeding on seedling field corn.
Although larvae are minute, less than 1/8 inch long
at hatching, they are not likely to be detected until
they are at least 1/2 inch long. At maturity larvae are
almost 1.5 inch in length (Photo 5-6). The caterpillars have three pair of true legs on the thorax and
five pair of fleshy “prolegs” on the abdomen.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Cutworms occur throughout the U.S. and
throughout Arkansas. Recent surveys have detected
large populations near Stuttgart and Des Arc. Larvae
feed on emerging seedlings and often cut off the
plant near or below the soil surface (Photo 5-7).
Several adjacent plants within the drill line can be
killed by a single cutworm. During 2002, damage
was severe in field corn near Des Arc, and several
fields required replanting. Also, rough or cloddy soil
appears to harbor larger cutworm populations.
Life History
Cutworms generally are capable of overwintering
as pupae in soil in Arkansas, especially in southern
counties. In addition to adults emerging in late
winter from the overwintered pupae, adult moths fly
into Arkansas from more southern states. Moths lay
eggs on many weed hosts and crops, including field
corn. Newly hatched larvae can produce “shot
holes” in corn foliage. Larger larvae often cut the
seedling and feed below the soil surface. Where
damage occurs, larvae can be detected by removing
the upper layer of soil near a damaged plant. The
number of generations per year varies from one to
three depending on cutworm species.
Management
The first step in cutworm management is proper
crop rotation. Corn that follows corn or corn
planted in recently turned pastures tends to have
more damage from cutworms. Also, adults are
attracted to fields with weeds on which eggs are
laid. Thus, early seedbed preparation prior to
planting reduces the likelihood of cutworm damage.
Providing a minimum of two weeks of host free
time prior to planting should reduce the attractiveness of the field to cutworm adults. Reduced or
no-till fields are more susceptible to economic
losses from cutworms. Also, seed beds prepared
during wet conditions are often cloddy. These may
later harbor increased numbers of cutworms. Bed
knockers or flat rolling beds can reduce the chances
of developing damaging cutworm populations. In
areas with histories of cutworm problems, treated
seed or soil insecticides applied at planting may be
justified. Foliar insecticide sprays may be used to
reduce cutworm populations, but early scouting for
damage is critical. Foliar insecticide sprays should
only be used when the damage levels exceed the
threshold of 6 to 8 percent of the seedlings with
cutworm damage above the surface of the ground or
2 to 4 percent of the plants cut below the surface.
Finally, insecticide success may be reduced when
late stage larvae are targeted as most of their time is
spent underground.
Insecticide Recommendations for
Cutworms on Field Corn
See Tables 5-1 and 5-2 for insecticide
recommendations current at time of publishing.

Seedcorn Maggot, Delia platura,
Diptera: Anthomyiidae
Description
Adult seedcorn maggots resemble house flies
but the body is somewhat slimmer and, at rest,
wings are held more backward directly over the
abdomen. The damaging form is the larval stage.
Larvae can be found attacking germinating seed. At
maturity, they are creamy white and about 1/4 inch
long (Photo 5-8). A distinct head and legs are lacking.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Seedcorn maggots occur worldwide and
throughout Arkansas. Many crops are attacked,
including field corn. Most problems in field corn
32 
occur in fields high in organic matter content.
Freshly plowed fields with decaying grass and
weeds are especially attractive to adult flies which
lay eggs near the decaying plant material. When
corn is seeded into this ground, the developing
maggots often move to the corn seed and can reduce
germination, seedling vigor and stand.
Life History
In northern states, the seedcorn maggot
overwinters as a pupa within the soil. All stages can
be found during mild winters in Arkansas. As spring
nears, adults seek decaying organic matter for egg
deposition. After hatching, larvae feed for one to
three weeks and pupate within the soil. Adults
emerge and renew the cycle. Multiple generations
occur each year in Arkansas.
Management
Planting in soils with fully decomposed plant
material should reduce the attractiveness of the
field to adult flies. Damage also is more severe in
fields where seed are slow to germinate and where
seedling growth is retarded. Thus, delaying planting until soil is warmer will reduce the impact of
the seedcorn maggot. Treated seed and soil insecticides applied at planting are effective tactics. Use of
insecticide sprays after maggot problems are detected
on germinating seed or seedlings is of no benefit.

Seedcorn Maggot on Field Corn

Sugarcane Beetle, Euetheola humilis
regiceps, Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae
Description
Adult sugarcane beetles are hard, shiny black
scarab beetles found in seedling corn at or just
below the soil level (Photo 5-9). Larvae can be
found in mid-season corn through late summer.
Larvae are cream colored grubs also found in the soil.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Surveys have detected adult sugarcane beetles
in southern Arkansas near Pine Bluff and Arkadelphia.
The adult produces the major damage. Seedling
corn is burrowed into at the base of stems generally
at the soil line (Photo 5-10). Plants are weakened
and may not fully develop. The greatest threat is in
fields recently converted from pastures to corn and
in reduced tillage systems with substantial grasses.
In Arkansas, impact of sugarcane beetle on field
corn has been minimal during the last four seasons.
Life History
Adult beetles overwinter in soil, particularly in
grassy areas. With warm spring temperatures, adults
are attracted to emerging corn seedlings and begin
to cut a small chamber in the stem near or just
below the soil level. Eggs are laid in soil in corn
fields, and developing larvae feed on corn roots but
cause little damage. Larvae pupate in late summer
and adults emerge and seek overwintering sites. One
generation occurs each year.
Management
In south Arkansas avoidance of recently
plowed grassy fields, including pastures, will
reduce the attractiveness of the field to adult sugarcane beetles. Damage also is more severe in fields
were seed are slow to germinate and where seedling
growth is retarded. Thus, delaying planting until
soil is warmer will reduce the impact of the sugarcane beetles. Treated seed and soil insecticides
applied at planting also are effective tactics.
White Grub, Phyllophaga spp.,
Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae
Description
White grub is generally a term given to the
larvae stage of a group of over 200 species of scarab
beetles. Adult descriptions vary greatly, but the most
common is referred to as the May beetle. These
adults are commonly found at lights during late
spring and summer nights. May beetles are about
1 inch long and tan to dark brown in color. Larvae
are cream colored scarabs with a tan head capsule
and dark internal markings on the end of the
abdomen (Photo 5-11). Six true legs are easily seen
on the thorax.
33 
Distribution, Damage and Impact
White grubs occur in the soil of corn fields
throughout Arkansas. Damage may occur when the
grubs feed on underground roots. However, in
recent surveys the impact of white grub has been
minimal. Fields recently converted from pastures
are most susceptible.
Life History
The biology of white grubs varies greatly due to
the many different species. In general, adults emerge
in the spring, mate and deposit eggs in a cell below
the soil line. Larvae hatch and can complete their
development through the summer and fall or may
take two or more years to mature. Pupation occurs
in the soil.
Management
In south Arkansas avoidance of recently
plowed grassy fields, including pastures, will
reduce the attractiveness of the field to adult beetles.
Rotation of corn with broadleaf crops, especially
soybean, will reduce the likelihood of damage. Use
of treated seed or soil insecticides applied at
planting may reduce larval populations but is not
likely to be economically effective if directed only
at the white grub.
Insecticide Recommendations for
White Grub on Field Corn

asp. Always follow instructions on pesticide labels.
Wireworm, Coleoptera: Elateridae
Description
Several species of wireworms occur in
Arkansas, and descriptions of the different species
vary. In general, wireworm adults, also known as
click beetles, are dark brown hard-bodied beetles.
The term “click” comes from the ability to snap the
hinge between the thorax and abdomen, resulting in
a flip that rights the upturned insect. Size varies but
adult wireworms in field corn are about 1.25 inch
long. Larvae occur in the soil. Although the larvae
of some species are white, the most common in
Arkansas is tan and at maturity about 3/4 inch in
length (Photo 5-12). True legs are evident and the
head is somewhat flattened.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Wireworms occur throughout the state, but the
major damage resulting from their feeding has been
observed in Clay County in northeast Arkansas and
near Paris in Logan County. Larvae feed on newly
planted seed, emerging seedlings and can be found
infesting the lower stems of larger corn plants
(Photo 5-13). Damage in some fields has been
substantial, and at times fields have been replanted
due to stand loss.
Life History
The biology of wireworms is also quite variable.
Some species complete two generations per year
while some require up to 5 years for a single generation. In general, adults emerge from overwintering
larvae in the spring and search for grassy fields.
Eggs are laid in the soil, usually where grasses are
available for the larvae to feed. When corn is planted,
the seed and emerging seedlings are burrowed into.
Seedlings can be weakened and killed. Wireworm
larvae can be found by carefully digging up weak
seedlings and searching the soil. In dry conditions,
wireworm larvae move deep into the soil and are
difficult to detect.
Management
In Arkansas, avoidance of recently plowed
grassy fields, including pastures, will reduce the
likelihood of damage from wireworms. Crop
rotations, i.e., corn following a broadleaf like
soybean, will reduce damage, but with wireworms
that require multiple years for development, damage
may be substantial. Damage also is more severe in
fields where seed are slow to germinate and where
seedling growth is retarded. Thus, delaying planting until soil is warmer may reduce the impact of
the wireworms. Although the use of treated seed and
soil insecticides applied at planting may provide
some control, wireworm problems persist in Clay
County despite insecticide application. Foliar
insecticide application to seedlings is of no benefit.

Aphids, including the Corn Leaf and
Bird Cherry-Oat Aphids, Rhopalosiphum
spp., Aphididae: Homoptera
Description
Aphids found on Arkansas field corn are minute
(less than 1/8 inch long) blueish-green insects
(Photo 5-14). Clear membranous wings may be
present, but wingless forms are more common.
Aphids occur in colonies which contain different
size nymphs and adults. As the newly born nymphs
increase in size, molting occurs and the white
exoskeleton is left on the leaf surface.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Aphid species that attack field corn occur
throughout the state and are often found in the
whorl of the plant during mid to late summer. Late
planted corn is generally more susceptible to
damage from aphid feeding. Aphids feed by
inserting their stylet or beak into the plant tissue and
removing plant sap. Large amounts of sap are
removed and the partially digested contents are
excreted onto the plant surface in the form of a clear
sticky honeydew. A dark grey mold may later form
on the honeydew. The level of injury in Arkansas
field corn appears to be minimal and generally does
not require management. Aphids also transmit viral
diseases, but aphid control is not effective in viral
disease management.
Life History
Aphids are capable of overwintering on
alternate host plants in Arkansas. Also, winged
aphids are carried into the state each spring on winds
coming from more southern areas. Adults colonize
grassy hosts and field corn seedlings, and reproduce
asexually through the summer. Development of
nymphs is rapid, and many generations occur each
season. As temperatures peak during mid to late
summer, reproduction rate declines. Thus, early
planted corn that matures in August generally is less
susceptible to aphid population increase. Later
planted corn, however, may experience large aphid
populations in early fall. Also, foliar insecticides
applied for corn borer management in mid to late
summer may reduce beneficial insect populations,
and result in aphid population increase.
Management
Early planted corn rarely harbors large aphid
populations. In late planted corn, aphid populations
may be very high, but when this population buildup
occurs on maturing corn, aphid management will
likely have little economic benefit. Excessive aphid
populations on actively growing corn may be
managed with foliar insecticides, but the benefits
may be very limited. Numerous beneficial
organisms affect aphids, including naturally
occurring insect pathogens, parasites and predators,
and insecticide use may reduce their effectiveness.
Some corn hybrids possess some level of resistance
to the aphid.

Corn Earworm, Helicoverpa zea,
Lepidoptera: Noctuidae
Description
Adults of the corn earworm, also known as the
cotton bollworm, are light tan in color and are about
1.25 inch long. Moths generally have green eyes.
Eggs are near white when laid but darken just prior
to larvae emergence. Larvae are initially minute,
about 1/16 inch, but at maturity can reach 1.75 inch
in length. Three pair of true legs occur on the thorax
and four pair plus an anal pair are found on the
abdomen (Photo 5-15). Color of larvae varies
35 
greatly. Mature larvae that have developed on
foliage are mostly green while those developing on
ears are reddish brown with longitudinal lines. The
pupal stage occurs in soil, and color ranges from
light tan shortly after pupation to dark brown just
prior to moth emergence.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
All stages of the corn earworm can be found
throughout Arkansas, and resulting damage may be
severe. This damage occurs in several forms,
including foliar damage to young corn, damage to
tassels and silks and direct damage to kernels
(Photo 5-16). The corn earworm also plays a role in
occurrence of aflatoxin. Damage to corn ears may
serve as an entrance for the fungi responsible for
producing aflatoxin.
Life History
Adults that are active in late winter arise from
two sources – overwintering pupae and flights of
moths from southern areas. Adults are attracted to
many host plants, but flowering plants are favored.
Eggs are deposited on foliage of seedling corn and
larvae consume large amounts of foliage. When
accurate counts are made, however, the percentage
of seedling corn plants infested with corn earworm
is generally very low and control is not feasible.
Later generations deposit eggs on silks and
emerging larvae chew down the silk channel to the
developing ears. Again, use of foliar insecticides to
reduce damage on ears is not economically effective
on Arkansas field corn. Regardless of host plant
structure on which the larvae develop, mature larvae
move to the ground and pupate within the upper
6 inches of soil. In Arkansas three or four generations occur each year.
Management
Foliar insecticides are not practical for corn
earworm management on field corn, and their use
may ultimately increase the problem. Numerous
beneficial organisms affect corn earworm, including naturally occurring insect pathogens, parasites
and predators, and insecticide use may reduce their
effectiveness. Soil insecticides may have some
effect on larvae attacking seedling corn but are not
practical if directed only at the corn earworm. Some
corn hybrids possess some level of resistance to the
corn earworm. Finally, the use of transgenic Bt
corn likely has some impact of reducing damage to
foliage and ears. Future transgenic lines may
possess much stronger toxicity to the corn earworm.

European Corn Borer, Ostrinia nubilalis,
Crambidae: Lepidoptera
Description
Corn borers, including the European and
southwestern corn borers, are the two most
destructive insect pests of field corn in Arkansas.
European corn borer adults are small, about 3/4 inch
in length, and fragile moths. At rest the wings are
held back over the abdomen but with a more
pronounced “V” shape than wings of the southwestern corn borer. Wings are yellow and brown
and exhibit a zigzag pattern (Photo 5-17). Males are
slightly smaller and darker than females. In
Arkansas, European corn borer adults may be
confused with adults of the garden webworm,
Achyra rantalis (Guenee), a much more common
but slightly smaller moth. European corn borer eggs
are laid in masses of up to about 25 cream colored
eggs in an overlapping fish scale arrangement. Upon
hatching, European corn borer larvae are about
1/16 inch in length and resemble newly hatched
southwestern corn borer larvae. Their abdomens,
however, lack the reddish tint on newly hatched
southwestern corn borers. As larvae mature, they
become more easily distinguished (Photo 5-18). The
tubercles of the European corn borer larvae are less
pronounced than on southwestern corn borer larvae,
and the upper integument is darker than the lower
integument.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
The European corn borer is more widely
distributed in Arkansas than the southwestern corn
borer. European corn borers can be found
36 
throughout the Arkansas River Valley, north central,
northeastern and eastern Arkansas. None have been
found in southwestern or southeastern Arkansas during
recent surveys. Impact of European corn borer
larvae on Arkansas field corn is severe. Shortly after
hatching, first generation larvae wander over the
leaf surface and begin to feed on unfolding leaves.
This feeding removes most of the leaf surface, leaving only a thin layer of the upper or lower epidermis.
Damage often appears as elongated “window panes”
parallel to the leaf veins. Young larvae also feed
completely through leaves still rolled in the whorl.
As these leaves unfold, a “shot-hole” appearance
may be observed (Photo 5-19). Second generation
larvae attack most structures on the corn plant. Ear
shank tunneling results in ear loss at harvest and
stalk tunneling reduces kernel size and yield. Additionally, European corn borer larvae are likely to
feed directly on ears. Although ear feeding likely
has little adverse impact on yield, this feeding may
serve to introduce pathogens that increase losses.
Life History
Mature European corn borer larvae overwinter
in corn stubble and other host plant material in
Arkansas. In April and May, European corn borer
adults begin to emerge from overwintering sites and
mate. Egg laying begins about two days after emergence and continues for about one week. Most eggs,
however, are deposited during the first two nights.
Eggs are very small, less than 1/32 inch in diameter
and, like the southwestern corn borer, are overlaid in
a mass resembling fish scales. Egg masses generally
consist of about 25 eggs. The entire egg mass is
only about 1/4 inch in diameter. Eggs are laid
primarily on the top and bottom of fully expanded
leaves and when ears are present, second generation
eggs are most often found on leaves within three
nodes above or below the ear. Egg development also
resembles that for the southwestern corn borer. With
warmer temperatures, larvae hatch in about five
days while requiring six or seven days in early
season when temperatures are lower. European corn
borer larval behavior is also similar to the southwestern corn borer larvae. First generation larvae
feed on the outer leaf layers for about 10 days and
later tunnel into the whorl and stalk. Damage
consists primarily of “shot holes.” Second and later
generation larvae damage ears, ear shanks and
stalks. European corn borer larvae are also capable
of tunneling within the upper stalk just below the
tassel. This often results in tassel breakage. In 1998,
numerous corn fields in eastern Arkansas experienced
complete tassel loss due to European corn borer.
Management
Management tactics follow the description of
the southwestern corn borer.
Southwestern Corn Borer, Diatraea
grandiosella, Crambidae: Lepidoptera
Description
Adults are inconspicuous white moths about
3/4 inch in length and have no obvious patterns on
the wings (Photo 5-20). Females are slightly larger
than males. At rest, adults fold wings almost parallel
to the abdomen. Newly hatched larvae are less than
1/8 inch long and have a black head capsule and
reddish tint on the abdomen. At maturity, larvae are
about 1.25 inch in length, have a reddish head
capsule and possess numerous black tubercles on
their integument (Photo 5-21). These spots and the
consistency of off white color of the integument on
both the dorsal and ventral sides of the larvae are
the most obvious distinguishing characteristics of
southwestern corn borer larvae. In contrast, the
spots are reduced and the dorsal integument is
darker on European corn borer larvae.
Distribution, Damage and Impact
The center of southwestern corn borer activity
in Arkansas is likely near West Memphis. Recent
surveys have detected almost 100 percent of non-Bt
field corn plants near Marianna and Marion infested
with southwestern corn borers. As distance from
West Memphis increases, frequency of southwestern
corn borer generally decreases. However, damage is
severe into Clay, Monroe and Woodruff Counties.
Damage is similar to that caused by the European
corn borer as described above. Loss of foliage by
first generation southwestern corn borer larvae is
generally minimal and has little direct effect on corn
plants in Arkansas. However, some larvae may tunnel
down through the whorl to the growing point of the
plant. Leaf tissue above the point of feeding can
turn white, a condition called “white heart.” If feeding
is extensive the plant may be stunted or killed. This
condition is called “dead heart” (Photo 5-22).
37 
When the southwestern corn borer first invaded
Arkansas during the 1950s, entire fields were lost to
“dead heart.” Recent surveys of field corn in eastern
Arkansas detected only low numbers of plants with
“dead heart.” In these fields, non-infested plants
adjacent to plants with “dead heart” appeared to
compensate for the lost plants and thereby limit
yield loss. Stalk tunneling is often severe, and as
much as 50 percent of the entire length of stalk can
be damaged. Yield losses are difficult to assess, but
use of the highly effective Bt corn has resulted in
yield increases of up to 80 bushels per acre. Tunneling
by southwestern corn borer in stalks may weaken
them to the point of breaking and falling across the
rows. This is called “lodging” (Photo 5-23). In
Arkansas, lodging from southwestern corn borer has
been common in the eastern and northeastern
portions of the state. In 1998, lodging in some corn
fields was about 30 percent of the total number of
stalks. Lodged stalks slow harvest operations, and
yield can be significantly reduced.
Second and third generation southwestern corn
borer larvae also feed on the ear shanks – the stem
connecting the ear to the stalk. Near harvest, affected
ears droop instead of pointing upward like noninfested ears. In a field located at Marianna, 46 percent of the ear shanks were infested by corn borers
in 1999. Although many of the infested ears are still
harvested, many fall to the ground before or during
harvest, which significantly reduces yield.
Yet another way in which the southwestern corn
borer affects corn yield is by reducing the size of
kernels. Preliminary studies conducted during 1999
sought to correlate the extent of tunneling in stalks
below the ear with kernel size. Although the effect
was limited, kernel size was negatively correlated
with increase in tunneling in stalks below the ear.
Tunneling may reduce water and nutrient movement
within stalks, thereby limiting kernel development.
Life History
The southwestern corn borer overwinters as a
mature cream colored larvae just below the soil line
in the stem/root mass of field corn. Adults emerge
from corn stubble in spring (May). Mating begins
within one night from emergence, and moths generally initiate egg laying or oviposition on the second
night after emerging. Eggs are off white in color
when laid, and may occur singly or in a small group
(Photo 5-24). Individual eggs are very small; i.e.,
less than 1/16 inch across, elliptical and flattened on
the leaf surface. Female moths may lay more than
300 eggs. However, under field conditions it is
uncommon to find more than four southwestern
corn borer eggs in a group.
The eggs laid by overwintering corn borers
represent the first generation of the year. Common
plant locations to find first generation eggs are
upper and lower leaf surfaces of young corn plants.
Although eggs from subsequent generations may be
detected on much of the plant, most will occur on
leaves within the area located two or three nodes
above or below the ear. About one day after being
laid, each southwestern corn borer egg develops
three reddish orange bars (Photo 5-25). Tiny black
spots, which are the head capsules of the developing
larvae become visible after three or four days.
Larvae within these eggs will emerge within about
one additional day. The duration of the egg stage is
dependent on temperature. Rolston (1955) reported
that most southwestern corn borers hatched six or
seven days after being laid in early July, when
temperature averaged 71°F. With average temperatures of 80° to 83°F, most eggs hatched in four to
five days, respectively.
First generation larvae that complete development,
pupate within corn stalks, and second generation
moths emerge in mid summer. These moths behave
similarly to those of the first generation by mating
and ovipositing. By the time oviposition of the
second generation occurs, the corn plant is decidedly
different in structure. At this time ears are often
present. Second generation southwestern corn borer
moths exhibit a strong preference for depositing
eggs on foliage near the ear. About 80 percent of the
second generation eggs can be found within three
nodes above or below the ear. When these second
generation larvae hatch, the corn plant offers much
more structure for the young larvae to penetrate and
hide within. The outer layers of ear shuck are often
penetrated by young southwestern corn borer larvae.
By searching for brown spots on the shuck and
carefully removing the outer layer, young larvae
may be detected.
Second generation larvae can develop within the
ear, particularly the ear shank, but more commonly
develop by feeding within corn stalks. Second
generation southwestern corn borer larvae affect
38 
corn plants in several ways. Most commonly, larvae
form extensive tunnels within stalks. When stalks
are infested with multiple larvae, the tunnels can run
from the soil line up through about 15 plant nodes.
Just prior to pupation, larvae can terminate a tunnel
just below the stalk surface. They leave only the
outermost layer of stalk, which soon turns brown.
This forms an exit hole. After larvae pupate within
the tunnel, the adult moth pushes out through the
exit hole and leaves the stalk to again mate and
begin egg laying.
Management – Southwestern/European
Corn Borer
Both the southwestern and European corn
borers are managed with four methods.
1. Early planting – Corn planted early in the
season may reach maturity before the second
generation corn borer larvae can negatively impact
yields. Planting dates vary with location, weather
and ground preparation. In eastern Arkansas corn
planted before April 15 can often avoid much of
the damage caused by the second generation of
corn borers.
2. Stalk destruction following harvest – Both
the southwestern and European corn borers
overwinter as larvae within old stalks. With environmental changes associated with spring, the larvae
initiate pupation and emerging adults begin the cycle
of egg laying. Research has consistently shown that
stalk destruction can reduce overwintering corn
borer populations by greater than 80 percent. From
the insect management view, the most effective
method of stalk destruction is to mow and disc
stalks shortly after harvest in late summer or early
fall. This leaves the overwintering larvae on or near
the soil surface where the effects of low temperatures
and rainfall have their greatest effect on producing
larvae mortality. Natural enemies, including
beneficial insects, rodents and birds, also contribute
to larvae mortality in stalks left on soil surfaces. In
late winter, prior to corn borer pupation, the stalk
residue should be turned under as much soil as
possible. This makes it more difficult for the
emerging moths to make their way out of the soil.
3. Soil and foliar insecticides – Much of the
corn acreage in Arkansas receives a soil insecticide
at planting. This may be directed at chinch bugs,
rootworms, cutworms or nematodes. The impact of
currently registered soil insecticides on corn borers
is not clearly understood. At present, it is doubtful
that currently registered soil insecticides directed
only at corn borers provide economically acceptable
returns. Additional research is currently underway to
more clearly define the benefits of these insecticides.
Corn borers are susceptible to several insecticides
applied to corn foliage. Difficulties with foliar
insecticide effectiveness are associated with corn
borer biology. First generation corn borers penetrate
corn structures within about 10 days of hatching and
second generation within about 7 days. After
entering the plant, corn borers are very difficult to
target. Thus, foliar applications must be timed
precisely to be effective. While the most effective
method of timing insecticides is by scouting for
corn borer eggs, it is a very difficult task. Use of
pheromone trap collections may provide a good
indication of when to initiate scouting.
Another method of monitoring adult flight is to
search for infested corn stalks. By visually inspecting
the ground for insect frass and the lower portion of
corn stalks for damage, corn borer larvae can be
easily detected. Once found, the stalk can be cut
with use of a large knife and carefully split. Both
larvae and pupae can be detected. When pupae color
changes from tan to dark brown, the moth will
emerge within a day or two. Mating and egg laying
begins one or two days after moth emergence and
eggs will hatch in about five days. Thus, foliar
sprays should be applied approximately seven days
from first detection of dark corn borer pupae.
If scouting is attempted, one method is to cut
20 plants from each of five locations in a field.
Plants should be removed from the field and foliage
searched. Applications should be initiated if greater
that 25 percent of the plants are infested. For first
generation corn borers, granular insecticides are
often chosen. Granules likely drop into the whorl
better than water based sprays. Granular insecticides
are not effective against second generation corn
borer. For second generation larvae, sprays are the
preferred choice. Spray volume is very important. In
1999, correctly timed foliar sprays provided acceptable levels of corn borer management when applied
in 20 gpa. Another method of foliar insecticide
application that should be successful is through
center pivot irrigation where available.
39 
4. Use of genetically modified corn hybrids –
Although field corn has been bred for many years to
resist attack by corn borers, the recent development
of field corn with the gene that codes for the
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin has met with
phenomenal success. Research in eastern Arkansas
and numerous other states in recent years has
demonstrated that Bt corn is highly effective against
both the southwestern and European corn borers.
With current populations of corn borers, planting of
Bt field corn will likely reduce corn borer impact to
more than acceptable levels. Critical in use of Bt
corn is managing its use to delay the development
of resistance in corn borers to Bt. Insects have a
well documented resistance to foliar applications of
Bt. As highly effective as Bt corn is against corn
borers, selection pressure is very high. Thus, the
corn producer is faced with insects that have developed resistance to similar Bt strains and are now
placing substantial selection pressure on the same
insect populations. Resistance development is only a
matter of time. Currently, the accepted method of
delaying resistance development is to maintain a
susceptible corn borer population through the planting of a portion of land with non-Bt corn. In addition
to resistance development, the other major problem
with use of Bt corn is with the public’s acceptance
of genetically modified organisms (GMO’s).

Fall Armyworm, Spodoptera fugiperda,
Lepidoptera: Noctuidae
Description
Fall armyworm adults are large bodied moths
with dark grey forewings that have lighter banding.
A light spot occurs near the apex of the forewings.
Mature larvae are up to 1.5 inch long, and are dark
brown in color with numerous black spots
(Photo 5-26). The head capsule has a distinct light
colored inverted “Y.”
Distribution, Damage and Impact
Fall armyworm occurs throughout Arkansas and
its impact on field corn is similar to that of the corn
earworm. This impact occurs in several forms including
foliar damage to young corn, damage to tassels and
silks and direct damage to kernels. The fall armyworm also plays a role in occurrence of aflatoxin.
Damage to corn ears may serve as an entrance for
the fungi responsible for producing aflatoxin.
Life History
In early spring, adults migrate into Arkansas
from more southern states, mate and seek suitable
host plants for egg laying. Eggs are laid in masses
that contain up to a few hundred eggs. Emerging
larvae feed for two to three weeks and then pupate
just below the soil surface. Multiple generations
occur each year.
Management
Foliar insecticides are not practical for fall
armyworm management on field corn, and their use
may ultimately increase the problem. Numerous
beneficial organisms affect larvae, including
naturally occurring insect pathogens, parasites and
predators, and insecticide use may reduce their
effectiveness. The use of transgenic Bt corn likely
has some impact of reducing damage to foliage and
ears. Future transgenic lines may possess much
stronger toxicity to the fall armyworm.

6 – Diseases and Nematodes

Rick Cartwright, Dave TeBeest and Terry Kirkpatrick
Corn diseases are important yield-limiting
factors in many production areas of the U.S. In
Arkansas, corn has been a minor field crop for many
years, and little disease research has been conducted.
Corn hybrids grown in Arkansas are developed by
private seed companies. Each company collects
information on diseases on their lines. Seed
company information is sometimes the only source
of disease resistance data on hybrids.
Good management practices, as outlined elsewhere
in this guide, can reduce the impact of many diseases
on corn. For example, many disease organisms
survive from crop to crop in infected residue, which
means that diseases can be worse in minimum
tillage corn than where the residue is thoroughly
incorporated into the soil each year. Stressed plants
are also often more susceptible to diseases, so
drought stress or poor drainage should be avoided.
Balanced fertility can also reduce disease problems,
so it is especially important to complete a soil test,
apply adequate potassium and other elements as
recommended, and to avoid excessive nitrogen use.
For specific problems, effective disease
management begins with correct identification of
the disease and its cause. The Cooperative
Extension Service offers two excellent diagnostic
services for Arkansas corn producers in this regard.
The Plant Disease Clinic at the Lonoke Research
and Extension Center can diagnose most corn
diseases, and the Nematode Assay Laboratory at the
Southwest Research and Extension Center near
Hope provides nematode diagnosis. These services
can be accessed by submitting diseased plant
samples – or soil samples for nematode analysis – to
the local county agent. The county agent can advise
you on the proper way to sample and what you can
expect in the way of results, in addition to sending
the sample to the appropriate lab. Currently, plant
disease diagnosis is free, while a small fee is
charged for nematode assays.
The following information offers brief
descriptions of some of the more common diseases
of corn in Arkansas and several suggested
management options, when they are known. If you
need additional information, please contact the
loca1 county agent.
Seed Rots and Seedling Blights
Corn seeds and seedlings may be attacked by
various seedborne or soilborne fungi (e.g., Pythium,
Diplodia, Fusarium, Pencillium, etc.) that cause
seed rot or seedling blight. These fungi may cause
significant stand loss in poorly drained, excessively
compacted, cold and/or wet soils. Seed rot and
seedling blight severity are also affected by planting
depth, soil type, seed age/viability, seed coat injury
and genetic resistance.
Symptoms – Aboveground symptoms of
seedling blights can be confused with mechanical,
insect or chemical injury. A soft rotting of stem
tissues near the soil, yellowing, wilting and death of
leaves are common symptoms on blighted seedlings.
Control – Plant high quality, injury- and
disease-free seed into a warm (soil temperature
consistently above 55°F), moist, but firm seedbed.
Use the most appropriate equipment to assure
proper placement of seed, pesticides and fertilizers
in order to promote the establishment of healthy,
vigorous seedlings. All commercial hybrid corn seed
is also treated with one or more fungicides, which
provides additional protection against seed rots.
Crazy Top
This disease is caused by the soilborne fungus
Sclerophthora macrospora, and it is occasionally
seen in Arkansas, usually in corn fields that have
been waterlogged early in the growing season.
45 
Symptoms – Infection usually occurs in young
plants (before the 5-leaf stage) exposed to flooded
soils for at least 24 to 48 hours. After infection, the
fungus grows within the plant, causing various
symptoms including excessive tillering (up to
10 tillers per plant), stunting, whitish striped leaves
or narrow, leathery leaves. The most striking
symptom occurs at tasseling, when the tassel
develops a twisted, leafy appearance that may
resemble tiny ears (Figure 6-1).
Control – Plant in fields with good drainage
and not prone to sustained flooding. Flooding early
in the season predisposes corn to infection. It is also
recommended that grassy weeds be controlled
because they may also be hosts of the fungus.
Anthracnose
Anthracnose is a widespread disease of corn,
and it is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum
graminicola. The disease is favored by long periods
of warm, wet weather. Although the fungus attacks
many grasses, including johnsongrass, it is believed
that isolates from corn do not attack grain sorghum,
and vice versa.
Symptoms – The first symptoms of the disease
are small spots that appear on the leaves of seedling
and mature plants. The lesions appear water-soaked
at first and enlarge to about 1/2 inch long tan with
reddish-brown bordered lesions over time, depending on the variety and environment (Figure 6-2).
The lesions may grow together, killing large leaf
areas or entire leaves. Fruiting bodies of the fungus
may be observed in the dead tissue with a hand lens
as clusters of dark, hairlike structures (called setae)
sticking out of the leaf.
Control – Use resistant varieties if available.
Practice crop rotation with soybean or rice and plow
under old crop residue. Maintain a balanced soil
fertility program and control weedy grasses.
Minimum tillage favors this disease.
Gray Leaf Spot
A fungus, Cercospora zeae-maydis, causes this
disease, which appears to have increased in many
corn production areas of the U.S. since the adoption
of minimum tillage. Heavy yield losses have been
reported in no-till corn fields of the eastern U.S.
under favorable weather conditions.
Symptoms – Leaf lesions develop on the older,
bottom leaves first, and the disease moves up the
leaves as the plant matures. The disease is favored
by long periods of warm, humid weather. The tan to
gray lesions are narrow and rectangular and occur
typically between the leaf veins (Figure 6-3). Under
favorable conditions, the lesions may join, killing the
whole leaf.
Control – Practice crop rotation with a
non-grass crop. Destroy infected corn residue with
good tillage practices. Use resistant varieties, if
available. Practice good weed control as johnsongrass and barnyard grass are hosts of the fungus.
Southern Corn Leaf Blight
Several “Helminthosporium” leaf blights attack
corn in the U.S. but the most common one in Arkansas
is probably Southern Corn Leaf Blight. This disease
is caused by the fungus Bipolaris (Helminthosporium)
maydis, and it attacks many other grasses besides
corn. In 1970, an epidemic of this disease destroyed
about 15 percent of the U.S. corn crop, costing an
estimated one billion dollars. Resistant corn hybrids
have kept it under control since then.
Symptoms – Leaf lesions vary in shape, color
and size but are generally oval to elongated, tan in
color, with yellow green halos to reddish brown
borders (Figure 6-4). Lesions may occur on leaf
blades, sheaths, stalks, husks and shanks. The
fungus may also attack ears causing a black, felty
mold on the kernels.
The fungus overwinters in soil and infected crop
debris as well as on infected kernels. The disease
may be favored by minimum tillage. Spores
produced by the fungus are windborne over long
distances or splashed by rain to other plants. The
disease is favored by long periods of cloudy, warm
and wet weather.
Control – Plant resistant varieties and plow
under crop debris. Rotation with non-host crops can
be effective. Fungicides are available but rarely
economical except in seed corn production (Table 6-1).

Rusts
Two similar rust diseases, common rust and
southern rust, occur on corn in Arkansas. Common
rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, and
the disease often develops when susceptible
varieties are grown under cool, wet weather
conditions. Southern rust is caused by the fungus
Puccinia polysora, and it may develop on
susceptible varieties when hot, moist weather
persists. Although rusts have not been of major
concern in Arkansas corn for several years, they
remain a potential problem.
Symptoms – Lesions or pustules that contain
the rust spores appear on all above-ground parts but
are most abundant on the leaf. Pustules are circular
to elongated, golden-brown to cinnamon-brown
early in the season (Figure 6-5). Pustules become
brownish-black as the plant matures. Southern rust
pustules are more common on the upper leaf surface
and less so on the lower surface than pustules of
common rust. Southern rust pustules also remain
covered by the epidermis longer than common rust
pustules. When the infections are severe, leaves and
leaf sheaths may turn yellow and die (Figure 6-6).
Control – Plant resistant varieties if available
(check seed company data). Avoid late planting and
excessive nitrogen fertilization. Fungicides are
available but can rarely be justified economically
(Table 6-1).
Charcoal Rot
The soilborne fungus Macrophomina phaseolina
causes disease on more than 400 different plants
including corn. Severe yield losses may result if hot,
dry weather persists during and after tasseling.
Symptoms – Infection can occur at any stage
from seedlings to plants approaching maturity. Early
symptoms include brown, water-soaked lesions on
the roots that later turn black. The fungus spreads up
into the lower stalk causing premature ripening and
lodging. Inside the stalk, symptoms include a dry,
stringy appearance rather than a solid pith.
Numerous black sclerotia inside the stalk give
the appearance of powdered charcoal, thus the
name. The rotting of the stem leads to lodging, with
plants bending over a few inches above the soil line
where it has become stringy inside.
Control – Charcoal rot losses can be minimized
by proper irrigation during the growing season.
Excessive nitrogen rates and low potassium
dramatically increase charcoal rot damage. Thus,
timely irrigation, combined with a well-balanced
fertility program based on soil tests, can effectively
reduce charcoal rot. Resistant varieties are not
available. The planting of high stalk strength
varieties is encouraged to reduce lodging.
47 
Other Stalk Rots
Various soil and seedborne fungi, including
species of Diplodia, Gibberella, Fusarium,
Macrophomina and Pythium, can cause stalk rot of
corn. The exact causal organism can be difficult to
identify. Stalk rots cause yield losses by increasing
lodging of the crop or by cutting off the supply of
water and nutrients from the roots. Stalk rots are
usually increased by drought stress, hail damage,
leaf diseases, high stand density, excessive nitrogen
fertilization, low soil potassium levels, lack of
rotation, possibly minimum tillage and stalk feeding
insects.
Symptoms – Stalk rots normally begin soon
after pollination, and become more severe as the
plant matures. Rotting affects the roots, crown and
lower internodes. Various discolorations of the pith,
including whitish-pink to salmon, are common as is
stalk breakage and premature ripening.
Control – Plant strong-stalked varieties to
reduce lodging. Practice balanced fertilization based
on recent soil tests and avoid excessive nitrogen.
Avoid narrow rows and excessive seeding rates if
possible. Control stalk insects and harvest as early
as possible.
Smut
Three types of smut generally occur on corn –
common, head and false smut. While these diseases
occur worldwide, only common smut is regularly
observed in Arkansas. Losses of 10 percent from
smut have been reported, but recently have tended
to be negligible as a result of the use of resistant
varieties.
Symptoms – All aboveground parts of the plant
are susceptible to common smut, but the tender ears
and tassels are more commonly attacked. Symptoms
are easily recognized on the corn ear as 1/4- to
1/2-inch diameter galls covered with glistening,
greenish to silvery-white skin (Figure 6-7). The
interior of the galls darken over time and turn into
masses of powdery, dark brown to black spores
(teliospores). Some galls at maturity may be 5 to 6
inches in diameter. Older affected plants may appear
reddish, similar to those heavily infested with aphids.
Soilborne teliospores overwinter and produce
spores in the spring that are carried onto young
plants by wind or by splashed water.
Control – Plant resistant varieties and avoid
mechanical injury to plants during spraying or
cultivation. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
Ear and Kernel Rot
Several widely distributed fungi are responsible
for ear and kernel rot. Economic losses are
common, especially in rainy years and on insect or
bird-damaged ears.
Symptoms – Early infections may be noticed as
bleached or straw-colored husks on the ear with
heavily infected ears remaining upright due to poor
grain fill and light weight. Late infections may show
no external symptoms, but when husks are removed,
mold growth is commonly found between the
kernels on ears with discolored tips (Figure 6-8).
Mold colors may range from white to black, with
pinkish color quite common.
Control – Plant only adapted corn varieties
known to have few ear rot problems. Fertilize
properly and control ear feeding insects as needed.
Harvest early to avoid increased ear rot on corn
standing too long in adverse weather. Store
harvested ears and grain at the proper moisture to
avoid increased rot in storage.
Storage Rots and Mycotoxins
Storage diseases of harvested corn grain in
on-farm bins are potentially serious problems in
Arkansas as they are throughout the southeastern
U.S. Not only can storage rots lower the quality of
grain through discoloration, mustiness, heating and
caking, but some of the causal fungi can produce
chemicals, known as mycotoxins, that are poisonous
to animals and humans. The most important fungi
involved include Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus
parasiticus, which produce aflatoxin, and Fusarium
species that produce zearalenone, vomitoxin and
other toxins. Not all moldy corn grain in storage
necessarily has mycotoxins, but if suspected,
laboratory testing must be conducted to confirm
their presence or absence. Various lab tests are used
including UV light to detect “glowers” (Figure 6-9)
but this method is no longer considered as accurate
as new “Elisa” test kits.
Symptoms and Control – See the section on
aflatoxin and proper grain storage for detailed
information.
48 
Nematode Damage
More than 40 species of nematodes have been
reported to feed on corn. There is little information,
however, on the level of damage nematodes cause
on corn grown in Arkansas.
Symptoms – Evidence of injury may vary with
species of nematode, its population level, soil type
and soil moisture. The major symptoms are stunting,
restricted root growth, lesions or galls on roots,
stubby roots, chlorosis and wilting (Figure 6-10).
Control – Cultural practices, including crop
rotation with non-host or less susceptible plants, and
prevention of soil compaction, which restricts
downward root growth, are often good nematode
management practices. Many corn varieties are
excellent hosts for root knot nematode (RKN) and
should not be used as a non-host rotation crop when
attempting to manage RKN in other crops such as
cotton or soybean. The reniform nematode and the
soybean cyst nematode, on the other hand, do not
appear to attack corn; and corn in rotation with
either soybean or cotton where these nematodes are
present will lower nematode populations. Resistant
corn hybrids may be available for some nematodes.
However, if nematodes are suspected, a soil
sample should be sent through the local county
agent to the Cooperative Extension Service
Nematode Assay Laboratory for assessment. There
is a small fee for this service but the correct
diagnosis can greatly help plan future rotations and
variety selection.
Virus Diseases
Several virus diseases attack corn. Maize dwarf
mosaic virus (MDMV) and maize chlorotic dwarf
virus (MCDV) are the most common in Arkansas.
Symptoms caused by double infections of these two
diseases are more severe than either alone.
Symptoms – MDMV symptoms are highly
variable, but usually first appear at the base of the
youngest leaves as an irregular, light and dark green
mottle or mosaic which may develop into narrow
streaks along veins. These can appear as dark green
“islands” on a yellowish background. Leaves may
become entirely yellowish-green as infected plants
mature. Plants with these symptoms are sometimes
stunted with excessive tillering, multiple ear shoots
and poor seed set. Early infection, which is vectored
by several species of aphids, may predispose maize
to root and stalk rots and premature death. Aphids
usually acquire the virus from johnsongrass in early
spring and infect corn plants later. The symptoms of
MCDV include yellow to white narrow stripes on
young, infected corn leaves. Infected plants are
stunted to various degrees and leaves may turn
partially or completely yellow and/or red, depending
on the severity of the disease (Figure 6-11). Unlike
MDMV, MCDV is transmitted by leafhoppers which
acquire the virus from infected johnsongrass.
Control – Plant only resistant varieties (seed
company information). Use good weed management
that especially reduces infestations of johnsongrass,
as well as other grassy weeds. It is critical to plant
as early as possible to avoid later buildup of insects
and increased disease. Rotate with cotton, soybean
or other non-grass crops.

7 - Weed Control In Corn

Kenneth Smith and Bob Scott
Weeds compete with corn to reduce yields,
cause harvesting losses and produce seed that
increase the soil seed bank. Even a light infestation
of weeds can reduce yields by 10 to 15 percent.
Heavy infestations may reduce yields as much as
50 percent if left unchecked during the season.
Ideally, weeds should be controlled throughout the
season. However, the most critical period is for the
first six weeks after planting.
The potential size of the ear is determined over
a three-week period starting about six weeks after
emergence. It is critical to have the corn growing
well without stress from competing weeds at this
time. Research has shown that one morningglory or
pigweed plant per 4 feet of row that is allowed to
remain uncontrolled for four weeks after emergence
will reduce yields by 4 percent.
Late season weed infestations have less effect
on produced yields, but may interfere with
harvesting and reduce harvestable yields. Late
season weeds are also very efficient at producing
seed to replenish the soil seed bank. Effective and
economical weed control in corn requires an
integrated program that includes good cultural
practices such as crop rotation and water management, judicious mechanical practices, proper
herbicide selection and proper weed identification.
Your county Extension agent receives extensive
training on weed identification and weed control
technology and is available to assist in developing
economical and effective control programs.
Recommended Chemicals for Weed and Brush
Control, often referred to as MP-44, is updated
annually to reflect the most current information on
herbicide label changes and revised recommendations based on research data. This publication is
available from county Extension offices throughout
the state. The color photographs at the end of this
chapter depict some of the more common weeds
found in corn in Arkansas.
Farmers have known for many years that
cultivation often prunes corn roots and can
reduce yields. Better available herbicide technology
has allowed more reliance on chemical weed control
and less on cultivation. It is estimated that near
100 percent of the corn grown in Arkansas receives
at least one herbicide application. Approximately
20 percent of this acreage is not cultivated after the
crop emerges. A very small percentage receives
cultivation after the corn reaches 8 inches in height
and roots begin to expand to the sides of the beds.
Possibly no other crop has as many weed
control options as corn. There are currently over
130 different herbicide brand names labeled for
weed control in this 75 million U.S. acres crop.
However, many of these brand names are simply
various mixtures of a much smaller number of
active ingredients. There are approximately
30 brand names listed in Arkansas’ MP-44,
Recommended Chemicals for Weed and Brush
Control.
The ten most troublesome weeds in corn in
Arkansas are morningglory, pigweed, johnsongrass,
broadleaf signalgrass, barnyardgrass, nutsedge,
sicklepod, velvetleaf, prickly sida and crabgrass.
Recommended control measures for these weeds are
usually quite effective. Adverse weather conditions
can cause control failures. The grassy weeds usually
compete most heavily with corn during the early
season, while morningglory and pigweed are often
most troublesome by germinating after layby and
causing harvesting problems.
Atrazine is the basis of most chemical weed
control programs in Arkansas corn, with over
80 percent of the acres treated receiving at least one
application. Atrazine may be applied alone or in
combination with other herbicides either preemergence or postemergence. Other herbicides are
often mixed with atrazine to broaden the weed
spectrum or to offer more residual weed control.
51 
Metolachlor (Dual Magnum), alachlor (Lasso)
and dimethenamid (Outlook) are acid amide –
sometimes called chloroacetamide – herbicides.
Although atrazine has some activity on grassy
weeds, it is considered a broadleaf product. The acid
amide herbicides have much more activity on grassy
weeds than on broadleaf weeds. Mixtures of
atrazine and one of the acid amides offer broad
spectrum weed control with good residual
properties. (See Table 7-1.)
Due to concerns about atrazine moving into
underground aquifers, there are some label restrictions governing mixing, loading and application in
proximity to water wells and reservoirs. EPA is
considering additional restrictions that, if implemented, could make atrazine use in Arkansas
impractical. University and industry scientists have
worked diligently over the past few years to identify
a herbicide with similar weed control attributes as
atrazine but without the regulatory restrictions.
Callisto (mesotrione) has been added to MP-44 as
an alternative in atrazine sensitive areas.
Preemergence herbicides are applied after the
corn has been planted and prior to emergence. Some
herbicides such as Dual Magnum are taken into the
weedy plants through the emerging coleoptile and
have little or no activity on emerged weeds. These
herbicides must be applied before targeted weeds
germinate. Dual, Lasso and Outlook primarily
control grasses such as crabgrass, barnyardgrass and
broadleaf signalgrass, but also suppress yellow
nutsedge and offer some control of pigweeds.
Combinations of these products with atrazine as
tankmixes or premixes applied preemergence will
control most seedling grasses and broadleaf weeds
for three weeks. Rainfall or irrigation is required to
incorporate the herbicides with the soil for activity.
This is often referred to as “activation” of the
herbicide. However, large rains immediately after
application may move some of the herbicide into
contact with the germinating corn seedling and may
actually be taken into the germinating seed as it
imbibes water. This usually results in delayed
emergence and some crop injury. Typical injury
symptoms include buggy whipping and slowed growth.
Under good growing conditions, the symptoms are
usually only cosmetic and the corn resumes normal
growth seven to ten days after emergence.
Postemergence herbicides are applied after the
corn has emerged and most often after the weeds
have emerged. Postemergence herbicides are used to
control emerged weeds that have escaped through
the preemergence herbicides or to extend the
residual weed control beyond what can be achieved
with preemergence herbicides alone.
Atrazine, 2,4-D, Clarity (dicamba) and Callisto
control broadleaf weeds when applied postemergence.
Atrazine may be applied until corn reaches 12 inches
tall, Clarity and 2,4-D over the top to 5-leaf corn
and Callisto may be applied on corn up to 30 inches
tall. Callisto and atrazine have some activity
postemergence on grassy weeds, but may provide
unacceptable control if used alone on grasses over
1 inch tall. Accent (nicosulfuron) is very effective
Buggy whipping or leaf wrapping is caused when the
leaves fail to unfurl. New leaves are trapped in the leaf
below, resulting in abnormal growth as shown. Factors
other than herbicides can also cause this symptom.
Buggy whipping is usually a temporary condition, and
plants will likely recover except under the most
extreme conditions.
52 
when applied to grassy weeds less than 4 inches tall.
Accent is often mixed with a broadleaf herbicide
such as Clarity, Basis (rimsulfuron) or atrazine to
offer both broadleaf and grass control.
Nutsedge and rhizome johnsongrass are
particularly troublesome perennial weeds. Permit
herbicide applied at 1.33 ounces per acre when
nutsedge is 4 to 12 inches tall is the most effective
treatment in conventional corn. However, if
nutsedge is allowed to reach 4 to 12 inches tall,
severe crop competition has already occurred.
Heavy infestations of nutsedge may require
sequential applications. An earlier treatment may be
required to prevent nutsedge from competing with
the crop. No more than 2.66 ounces of Permit may
be applied in one growing season. Repeat
applications of Accent or Beacon (primisulfuron)
may be required for acceptable rhizome
johnsongrass control. Accent and Beacon may be
applied over the top of corn until the 20- and
24-inch stage of growth, respectively.
Herbicide tolerant corn varieties are available
that will allow use of glyphosate (Roundup Ready®
varieties) or imazethapyr/imazapyr (Clearfield®
varieties). There are several formulations of
glyphosate available and labeled for use on
Roundup Ready® corn. Rates and use patterns vary
by formulations, and labels should be checked prior
to using any herbicide. Sequential applications of
glyphosate are very effective for control of a broad
spectrum of both grass and broadleaf weeds.
Because glyphosate has no soil residual properties,
multiple applications are usually required to provide
a level of weed control that will not allow competition to reduce yields.
A soil residual herbicide should be applied to
prevent late season weeds from germinating and
causing harvesting problems. Lightning
(imazethapyr + imazapyr) used in conjunction with
Clearfield® varieties is very effective on a broad
spectrum of broadleaf and grass weeds when
applied early postemergence at 1.28 ounces per
acre. Lightning does have some soil residual activity
and may offer season long control of many troublesome weeds. Cotton and rice rotation restrictions
following Lightning may reduce the utility of this
system for some Arkansas corn farmers.
Herbicide resistant weeds are becoming more
of a problem in all crops. Pigweeds with resistance
to atrazine are common in other states, but have not
been found in Arkansas at this time. Due to the fact
that most corn in Arkansas is rotated with other
crops, there have been no weeds identified as being
resistant to corn herbicides. This does not diminish
the importance of resistance management and
maintaining a close watch for suspected resistance.
If weeds are not controlled by a particular herbicide
application and resistance is suspected, they should
be treated with an alternative herbicide and the local
county agent should be contacted. The University of
Arkansas will collect weed specimens and test for
resistance. Weeds that are suspected to be herbicide
resistant should not be allowed to produce seed in
the field.

8 – Corn Harvesting

Gary Huitink
A combine equipped for corn is the starting
point for successful harvesting. In the midsouth,
combine components vary, requiring you to confirm
that your combine has proper options to obtain full
capacity and efficient cleaning in corn. Plan to
harvest the bulk of your corn between 15 and
18 percent moisture content, for an economical
choice based on recent grain terminal moisture
discounts and long-term Arkansas weather patterns.
Other considerations, such as scheduling rice
harvest, are briefly noted in the section “Corn
Harvest Moisture.” Fine tune the combine in the
field. Have a bit more handling and drying capacity
than shelling capacity to prevent field delays.
Corn Equipment
A corn head and rasp-bar cylinder or rotor
modifications are needed for corn. Check your
combine before purchasing a corn head. New costs
for conversion to corn vary from $25,000 to
$50,000. The cost is lower if you already have some
of the corn options and if good used equipment can
be found. Due to differences between combine
models, your dealer can help identify corn features
appropriate for your combine. Certain models require
a corn head drive and feed elevator. A variable
speed header drive allows faster synchronized (with
the stalk roll speed) forward speed. If your combine
has a feed elevator compatible with corn, conversion cost is less.
To equip a combine for corn, check with your
dealer after determining:
• Combine model
• Serial number
• Thresher (Rasp, Spike or Rotor)
• Header drive option
Corn Head
Row spacing should match the planter. Research
indicates gathering loss can increase 2 1/2 bushels
per acre if the gathering opening is 4 or 5 inches
off the row. If damage from windstorms or corn
borers causes ears in misaligned rows to drop off,
field losses often exceed 10 bushels per acre. Corn
heads aligned with combine wheels and matched
with planters and row bedders improve combine
performance.
Rasp-Bar Cylinder or Threshing Rotor
A rasp-bar cylinder, concave and filler bars or a
threshing rotor are needed for corn. Check your
operator’s manual for the correct concave wires or
rotor grates and transport vanes. Converting from a
spike-tooth to a rasp-bar cylinder reduces the
combine’s ability to handle downed rice, weedy
fields and rank, green stalk. A rasp-bar cylinder
normally improves head rice yield and reduces field
loss in corn, grain sorghum, wheat and soybeans.
Counterbalance Weights
Due to the extra weight of a corn head, steering
improves by adding extra rear weights and/or fluid
in the rear tires.
Corn Harvest Moisture
Harvesting causes some kernel damage; the
relationship of kernel damage to moisture content is
summarized in Figure 8-1. Depending on the variety
and seasonal conditions, minimum kernel damage
occurs between 19 and 24 percent moisture content
(m.c.). In some cases, damaged corn has been
discounted as foreign material or dockage.
65 
Figure 8-1. Broken Kernels vs. Corn Moisture Content
Preharvest and gathering losses vary with insect
damage, lodging and how tightly ears are held. Ear
droppage begins in the 20s (percent m.c.) and
accelerates as corn dries. Storms come without
much warning; therefore, verify if stalk rot or insect
damage exists in each corn field. If the risk of
lodging is high, harvest early (around 20 percent
m.c.) to avoid a potential 10- to 20-bushel per acre
field loss.
Rice harvest may also conflict with corn
harvest. It may be desirable to harvest corn at 18 to
24 percent moisture to allow time to clean and
empty equipment before handling rice. In most
cases this requires farm drying, so allow sufficient
time to dry the corn properly. If rice and corn
production schedules aren’t planned, inadequate
drying or grain storage may prevent timely harvest.
Corn drying rates in the field vary from 1/2 to 1 percent moisture content loss per day. Starting harvest
at 24 percent instead of 18 percent moisture may get
the combine into the field 6 to 12 days earlier (or
more if high humidity conditions persist when corn
nears 18 percent m.c.).
Aflatoxin isn’t likely to be a problem in wellmanaged corn. However, aflatoxin proliferates so
rapidly in midsouth fields that a grower should
consider his options. If corn can be dried to 15 percent or below within a day, the spread of aflatoxin is
minimized by early corn harvest. Corn with as much
as 28 percent moisture can be harvested by adjusting
the combine for reduced kernel damage and
improved separation. See your county Extension
agent for the options on harvest strategy and adjusting
the combine to remove more aflatoxin-prone grain.
More suggestions are included in Chapter 10, Grain
Storage and Aflatoxin in Corn. The Arkansas State
Plant Board will perform an analysis on a sample of
corn to identify sample field aflatoxin levels, These
tests are a good basis for evaluating your situation
and avoiding severe discounts.
Drying costs or high-moisture market discounts
cause some to wait too long to harvest corn. Corn
that remains in the field too long suffers weight
shrinkage, damage and field loss. Gathering loss
increases as corn moisture falls below 20 percent;
field loss may get unnecessarily high – above
5 bushels per acre.
Economical harvest timing depends on the
drying cost or high-moisture discounts, field loss
and damage penalty. Look at your circumstances,
including the risk of field loss, how quickly all of
your corn can be harvested and your drying and
market options. Recover most of the drying cost by
reducing field loss and kernel damage. On this
basis, beginning corn harvest at 20 percent m.c. is a
sound decision for some; starting harvest around
18 percent m.c. fits many situations. Exposure to
weather risks, shrinkage, field loss and damage are
compelling reasons to complete all corn harvest
before it reaches 14 percent m.c.
Gathering Corn
Height
Operate the corn head low enough in good,
upright corn that all gathering chains enter the row
below the lowest ears. Lodged stalks may require
lowering the gathering height so row dividers follow
the ground contour freely. Keep the stalk rolls well
above the soil to prevent rapid wear. Slowing
forward speed recovers more ears that tend to drop
easily from lodged stalks, etc.
Synchronize Speeds
Properly matching forward speed, stalk-roll
speed and gathering chain speed reduces corn loss
and plugging. Choose a forward speed that synchronizes with the gathering chain speed to guide stalks
66 
gently into stalk rolls. Excessive chain speed can
break stalks, plug the rear of the stalk rolls, increase
chain wear and overload the combine. Synchronize
the gathering chain flights, positioning the tip about
1/4 inch beyond the edge of the snapping plate.
Snapping Opening
Stalk rolls pull stalks down between two
snapping plates that strip the ears from the stalks.
The rear of all snapping plates needs a 1/8-inch
wider gap than the front. Refer to your corn head
manual; typically, adjust the front 1 1/4 to 1 3/8
inches apart and the rear 1 3/8 to 1 1/2 inches apart.
Use narrow spacing for small ears. A wide spacing
is one cause of shelling from the butt of the ear and
may cause small ears to drop partially below the
snapping plates. Check that stalk roll spacing and
snapping plate spacing are the same on all rows.
Excessive forward speed
•	 Knocks ears off before they enter the
gathering throat.
•	 May cause plugging in high-yielding corn
due to overloaded gathering units.
Excessive stalk roll speed
•	 Chews stalks and may wedge ears on the
snapping plates causing shelling loss
along the row.
•	 May shake ears off before stalks are fully
in the throat.
Inadequate stalk roll speed
•	 May break or pull up stalks, causing
plugging at the back of the rolls.
•	 Extra stalks entering the combine
potentially can overload separation.
The stalk roll gap should allow stalks to enter
without restriction. The rolls have several flutes or
adjustable knives that, properly adjusted, grip stalks
and pull them down without slippage. Stalk roll
replacement is expensive, but field capacity is
reduced when flutes are worn. Field loss becomes
high as rolls wear and “slip” in contact with corn
stalks.
Stalk Roll Spacing
• 	Wide for dry crops
•	 Narrow when stalks are damp and tough
(to reduce snapping plate shelling)
•	 Center all snapping plate gaps over center
of roll openings to avoid breaking weak
stalks
Troubleshooting
(Refer to your Corn Head Operator’s Manual)
Excessive Shelling at Stalk Rolls
1.	 Snapping plate gaps should be narrower at the
front than at the rear to avoid wedging ears into
stalk rolls.
2.	 Adjust stalk rolls to pull stalks firmly down
through the snapping area. Ears should snap off
quickly about half way up the snapping plates.
3.	 Excessive wear on stalk rolls. Replace.
4.	 Loose gathering chains. Adjust tension.
Pulling Up Stalks
1.	 Forward speed may be too fast in relation to
gathering chain speed.
2.	 The snapping plate gap may be too narrow.
Spread the snapping plates a little farther apart
to get stalks to feed through freely and snap the
ear cleanly. Try 1/8-inch adjustment increments
on each side of the row.
3.	 Not operating on rows planted together; i.e.,
rows not centered.
Weeds, etc., Wrapping Stalk Rolls
1.	 Shields on the front of the stalk rolls should cover
half of the spiral points to minimize wrapping.
67 
2.	 Weed knives along the back side of the stalk
rolls should be adjusted just as close as possible
without touching rolls. Replace missing, worn
or bent knives.
Row Alignment
1.	 Select harvest speed to keep units centered on
the row.
2.	 Pick “matched rows.” Rows not planted together have spacing variations that may increase
stalk breakage or plugging.
Plugging
Never allow anyone to work on a corn head
while it is running. Plugged stalk rolls can be
cleared one stalk at a time while the rolls are
stationary.
1. If stalks break in the snapping rolls,
recheck that the snapping plates are
centered over the roll opening.
2. Operating too fast in high-yielding corn
may overload gathering units or the cross
auger. Stalks should move through
smoothly. Check whether your header has
a faster speed option for cross auger.
Threshing and Separating
Thresher speed and concave gap are basic to
good shelling. Whole cobs with some attached
kernels behind the combine are a clue that a
narrower concave spacing or a faster thresher speed
may improve shelling. If a few soft, immature cobs
break up without removing all the kernels, don’t be
concerned.
A fast thresher speed breaks cobs excessively
and increases kernel damage. If too many wet cobs
shell poorly, don’t thresh too aggressively. Delaying
harvest to allow more field drying may solve this.
Splitting cobs down their length is usually due to a
narrow concave gap.
Corn Quality
Within the typical harvest moisture range,
threshing is the likely cause for cracked
kernels. Concave gaps narrower than 5/8 inch
or thresher surface speeds above 3500 feet per
minute can lower corn below USDA Grade
No. 2 requirements. “Fines” or broken kernels
are the primary cause of “heated,” “sour” and
“weevily” corn, especially if they are allowed
to remain in the center of the bin.

Research indicates that damaged shelled
corn deteriorates in storage three times faster
than undamaged samples. Corn damaged,
either by a combine or handling, develops
mold and may deteriorate from No. 2 corn to
No. 3, 4 or 5 corn, depending on the storage
conditions. If adequate aeration is available in
storage, corn kernel damage essentially determines the maximum allowable storage time.
About 90 percent of the separation should occur
at the thresher. Gentle threshing aids corn recovery
on the grates or walkers and sieves. Corn carries out
over the straw walkers or chaffer sieve if they
become plugged with cobs. Walker risers
(“fishbacks”) or walker grate covers may help,
especially when the crop is damp.
Cleaning requires a high-speed fan. Use the
operator’s manual for initial combine settings and
fine tune fan speed for field conditions.

Field Loss
Field loss was sampled behind 84 combines in
Iowa (Table 8-3). Failure to gather ears was the
greatest loss (cost) category in Iowa and may be in
Arkansas. Separating losses and shelling at the stalk
rolls are other common problems. Some producers
may increase corn income by reducing field loss by
several bushels per acre.

Estimating Field Loss
Everyone wants to do an expert job of harvesting.
One way to gain expertise is to check field losses
and compare them to top growers. Field loss can be
estimated quickly. Losses are determined by
counting shelled corn and ears left in the field.
Corn normally dries at the rate of 1/2 to 1 percent
moisture content per day in the field. Approximately
two weeks before harvest is a good time to begin
measuring corn moisture and counting field ear loss.
Counting ears on the ground prior to harvest as well
as behind the combine provides facts to optimize
harvest profit. If loss is high, the kind of loss is a
clue to making adjustments. Keeping losses low
doesn’t cost; it pays!
Procedure
To count field loss, choose a representative field
portion at least 100 yards from the end. Disconnect
the straw spreader or straw chopper to aid in diagnosing the source of loss. Otherwise, kernels thrown
into adjacent rows will add confusion about where
the loss really occurred.
Ear Loss
Ear loss is sampled in 436 square foot areas
(1/100 acre) (Table 8-4) and kernel loss in 10 square
foot areas. Sample the field ear loss first and then
determine what portion occurred at the corn head.
Then measure preharvest ear loss. In fact, making
early preharvest loss samples prior to entering the
field with the combine helps to identify which field
to harvest first and, possibly, when to start.

Step 1: Field Ear Loss. Back the combine
about 10 feet out of the row to provide space to
count loss. Due to extra discharge when stopped,
note how far behind the combine to count loss
(Figure 8-2). Step off the correct distance behind the
combine according to your corn head and row
spacing (Table 8-4). Mark this distance down the
row and count all whole or broken ears (not those
that have been threshed). Estimate the number of
full ears (one 3/4-pound ear in 436 square feet

equals one bushel per acre). Record the field ear
loss in bushels per acre in Table 8-5.
Step 2: Preharvest Loss. Pace off the same
distance in standing corn (Figure 8-2). This is the same
sample size (Table 8-4), 1/100th acre, which was
measured behind the combine. Gather and count all
the dropped or “unrecoverable” ears in these rows
and record this in bushels per acre in Table 8-5.
Step 3: Corn Head Ear Loss. In Table 8-5,
subtract the preharvest loss from the field ear loss to
determine loss caused at the corn head.

Kernel Loss
Count loose kernels on the ground and those
still attached to threshed cobs. Do this by
measuring a distance down the row to enclose
10 square feet (Table 8-6), one row at a time. A
frame appropriate for your row spacing can be
constructed. A PVC pipe frame or a plastic
clothesline, with pegs at the corners of a rectangle
is helpful. Complete steps 4 and 5 (Table 8-8) for
each row and then move the frame to sample the
next row.

Square Feet for Kernel Loss Counts

28 52
30 48
36 40
38 38
40 36
Step 4: Corn Head and Separation Loss. Place
the frame behind the combine and count loose
kernels (not those remaining on threshed cobs).
Record the number of kernels as corn head and
separation loss, by row, in Table 8-8. Convert the
number of kernels in 10 square feet to bushels per
acre by dividing by 20.
Step 5: Threshing Loss. Before moving the
frame, count kernels on threshed cobs (not loose
kernels) and record the number of kernels as
threshing loss, by row, in Table 8-8. Ignore small
kernels on the tips of cobs. Convert the number of
kernels in 10 square feet to bushels per acre by
dividing by 20.
70 
Step 6: For each row, add the second (Step 4,
Corn Head and Separation Loss) and third (Step 5,
Threshing Loss) columns to obtain a Combine
Kernel Loss value in the fourth column of
Table 8-8. The average of all rows indicates the
field shelling losses caused by the combine. These
typically increase as corn dries in the field.
Step 7: Corn Head Kernel Loss. Place the
10 square foot frame over each harvested row in
front of the corn head where the separator has not
yet discharged. Count the loose kernels by row
within the frame (disregard ears). This corn head
kernel loss can also be converted to bushels per acre
by dividing by 20. Note if there is a particular row
that has an unusually high or low value.
Step 8: Separation Loss. For each row, subtract
corn head kernel loss, Step 7, from corn head and
separation loss, Step 4, and enter the value in the
last column as separation loss. This is the corn that
was not separated from chaff.
Table 8-7. Corn Loss Measurement
Uniformly Distributed
2 kernels
square foot = 1 bu/A
One 3/4 lb ear
436 square feet = 1 bu/A
With timely harvest, field loss may be as low as
1 to 2 bushels per acre. Weak stalks, poor ear retention or lodged corn are causes of high preharvest
loss and high gathering loss. Poorly equipped, maintained or operated combines may leave 5-10 bushels
of corn per acre in the field. Preharvest repairs, field
adjustments and careful operation prevent most
costly field losses.
Evaluate both gathering and separating losses to
determine the best field speed. Adjust for tough
stalks, ears that drop easily and lodged fields. Time
your harvest to balance field loss and damage with
the costs of higher corn moisture using your drying
cost or current market discounts.

9 - On Farm Storage and Drying

Dennis R. Gardisser
A good deal of Arkansas corn will be dried and
stored on the farm each year. Corn has the highest
quality it will ever have at harvest. Grain has a
limited storage life. The way that corn is handled
during the drying and storage process will determine
how much of this quality is retained. Proper
management practices may also prolong the storage
life of grain.
Corn should be quickly dried down to a
moisture level of about 12 percent for storage –
particularly if it is going to be stored for several
months. Corn is typically dried to 15.5 percent when
it is expected to be marketed right away. The
reduction of grain moisture is done by passing
relatively large quantities of dry air over the corn
after it is placed in the bin. The quality of this air
determines the final moisture content of the corn
kernel. This “air quality” is typically referred to as
the equilibrium moisture content (EMC). If the air
has an EMC of 12 percent and is moved over the
grain long enough, then the grain moisture will
eventually reach 12 percent.
A given volume of air has the capability of
holding a given amount of moisture. The amount of
moisture that air can hold will depend on the quality. One way to increase drying potential or cause the
grain to reach equilibrium with the air sooner is to
pass larger amounts of air over the grain. Doubling
the air flow will typically cut the drying time in
about half.
Pass or continuous flow dryers are often utilized
to speed up the drying process. These high flow driers pass very large amounts of high temperature air
over the corn. Three to six moisture points may be
taken from the grain in a single pass. This helps to
prepare grain for shipment if the desire is to market
the grain quickly. Quickly drying the grain down to
values of 16 percent or less will lessen potential
spread of toxins if that is a concern. In-bin drying is
more gradual and may cause less stress and potential damage on the kernels.
As grain bins are filled and the grain depth
increases, it becomes more difficult to pass air up
through the grain. As the grain depth increases,
there is also less air available for each bushel of
grain in the bin. High volumes of air are needed to
carry the moisture away in a timely fashion when
the grain is at high moisture levels. Most on-farm
73 
bins have a limited amount of available air capacity.
These criteria dictate that bins should not initially be
filled too full if the grain is at a high moisture content. Once grain moistures reach 15 percent or less
throughout the bin, the bin filling process may be
completed. Graph 9-1 illustrates the dramatic
increase in fan horsepower/capacity needed to push
grain through varying depths of grain. Requirements
can quickly overwhelm available power as the grain
depth and air requirements (CFM – cubic feet per
minute) increase.
Several rules of thumb have been developed for
sizing fans for dyring systems1: (1) doubling the
grain depth at the same cfm/bushel air flow rate
requires 10 times more horsepower and (2) doubling
the cfm/bushel air flow rate on the same depth of
grain requires 5 times more horsepower.
Air flow rates for drying vary from 0.5 cfm/
bushel to more than 50 cfm/bushel for commercial
or batch dryers. Most on-the-farm air flow rates for
drying vary from 0.5 to 6 cfm/bushel dependent on
the initial moisture content of the grain and the
amount of heat added to the drying air. Recommended minimum air flow rates for different
moisture contents are as follows.
% moisture cfm/bushel
11 to 13 0.5
13 to 15 1
15 to 18 2
18 to 20 3
20 to 22 4
>22 6
When air flow rates are less than 1 cfm/bushel,
add little or no heat. A rough guide for temperature
increases through the heaters at various air flow
rates is as follows.
•	 For an air flow rate of 1 to 2 cfm, limit the
temperature rise to 6°F.
•	 For an air flow rate of 2 to 3 cfm, limit the
temperature rise to 12°F.
•	 For air flow rates above 3 cfm, a 20°F
temperature rise is permissible. A temperature
rise above 20°F is satisfactory for some feed
grains when drying depths are less than 4 feet or
stirring depths are used.
•	 Batch and/or pass dryers typically use much
higher temperatures, but also have much higher
air flow rates. Grain kernels may protect themselves somewhat as long as they are giving up
water and there is evaporative cooling in or near
the kernel.
In most on-the-farm storage, the grain is
subjected to modest temperatures for long periods of
time. There must always be sufficient air flow to
cool the upper portions of the bin to eliminate the
possibility of mold development in that area. The
top layers are the last segment of the bin to reach a
safe moisture level.
Grain may be dried without adding any heat if
the EMC is low enough. Careful monitoring of the
EMC and managing drying times to optimize low
values will provide the most economical drying.
Many times Mother Nature simply will not provide
dry enough air, particularly at night, and the
addition of heat is needed to condition the air to the
correct EMC.
Fan Types
Vane-axial fans supply more cfm per
horsepower at static pressures below 4.0 to
4.5 inches of water, low grain depths, than
centrifugal fans. For this reason, these fans are
generally better adapted to shallow-depth bin drying
systems, such as batch-in-bin and continuous-in-bin
systems, and to deep bin drying up to 20-foot depths
requiring 1 cfm/bushel air flow or less. They are
generally lower in initial cost, but operate at a
higher noise level than centrifugal. These fans are
generally not acceptable for use with bins that will
also handle rice because of the high static pressures
that are expected – typically, air is more difficult to
move up through a column of rice.
Centrifugal fans supply more cfm per
horsepower at static pressures above 4.0 to
4.5 inches of water than vane-axial fans. These are
especially advantageous when the application
requires relatively high air volumes through deep
grain levels (12 to 20 feet), and where low noise is
1AE-106, Fan Sizing and Application for Bin Drying and Cooling of Grain, Purdue University CES.

important. Larger diameter centrifugal fans typically
move more air per horsepower.
All fans are susceptible to a reduction in the
amount of air that can be moved as the static
pressure increases. Air flow will be less when fan
blades are coated with lubricants, dust and other
foreign materials. Keep all fan blades clean for
maximum performance.
Care should be taken not to mix dry grain
(moisture content less than 15 percent) with moist
grain (moisture content greater than 18 percent).
Re-wetting may also occur if damp air is pumped
through the grain.
The EMC may be determined by measuring air
temperature and relative humidity. A sling
psychrometer is one the best tools for measuring relative humidity, and is relatively inexpensive. A sling
psychrometer works by measuring the air temperature with a wet and dry bulb thermometer, and then
using a table to determine relative humidity.2
One should strive to maintain a steady EMC
that is very close to the target storage moisture
content. There are typically numerous days during
and shortly after the harvest season when the EMC
is at or below the desired level without adding any
heat. At night or during damp weather conditions it
may be necessary to add some heat to condition the
air to a desirable EMC – or to maintain the same
level available during the daylight hours. If heat is

75 
not available, it may be better to turn the fans off at
night instead of pumping in moist air. Moist air that
is pumped in at night has to be removed later. This
increases drying cost and may result in significant
HRY reductions. Fans should be turned off almost
any time the EMC of the air is greater than that of
the grain. The exception might be for very damp
corn – to avoid heat buildup.
Stir alls help to mix the upper and lower
portions of grain in the bin. This speeds up the
drying process and loosens the grain so that additional air may be moved up through the grain. Stir
alls also help to keep the grain level in the bin. Stir
alls should not be turned on unless the bottom end
of the auger is about 1 foot deep in grain. They can
run almost continuously after that point, when the
drying fans are running. There is a concern among
many producers that the stir alls may grind away at
the corn if left on, but there is no research evidence
to support this. There will be a small amount of
flour-like substance formed around the auger top,
but the small particles were most likely already
there and are just being gathered in one place with
the auger action.
Grain should not be allowed to cone or pile to
one side as the bin is being filled. If coning or sloping occurs, the large particles will migrate to the
outside and the flour-like small particles and trash
will remain at the center of the cone. This results in
a very non-uniform amount of air being passed
through each portion of the grain. Most of the air
will pass up the outside of the bin through the larger
and cleaner grain. A level height should be maintained throughout the filling process. Once the separation occurs, it is hard to remedy – even if the bin
is later shoveled level. Do not fill a bin to a peak or
until the grain touches the roof. This will interfere
with uniform air flow and prevent moisture movement out of the grain surface. Level fill works best
at any level!
Drying Costs
Fuel (BTU/lb water x lb water removed/bu x
Cost = cost of fuel per unit x 100
($/bu) (BTU/unit of fuel x burning efficiency (%))
The number of BTUs to extract 1 pound of
water will vary from 1,100 to 1,400 and is a
function of how easily moisture is given up by the
kernel. As the kernel begins to dry, it takes more
energy to get the last bit of moisture out. A good
estimate is to use an average number of 1,200
BTU/pound of water. BTUs/unit of fuel are LP
Gas – 92,000 BTU/gal, natural gas – 1,000 BTU/ft3,
and electricity – 3,413 BTU/kWh. Burning efficiencies are 80 percent for LP and natural gas and 100
percent for electricity.
Long-Term Storage Management
•	 Cool grain off as soon as possible in the fall.
Target temperatures should be initially around
60°F.
76 
•	 Continue to aerate and uniformly cool grain
down to 30° to 40°F if possible. This will help
avoid internal moisture migration and insect
activity.
•	 Monitor grain and aerate monthly to maintain
uniform temperature and moisture levels
throughout. Aerate more often if moisture or
temperatures increase.
•	 Keep grain cool as long as possible into the
early spring.
•	 Do not aerate in early summer unless problems
develop.
•	 Cover fans and openings when not in use to
help avoid air, moisture and potential insect
movement.
•	 Monitor carefully and fumigate if needed. The
grain surface should be inspected at least every
week throughout the storage period. Walk over
the grain and poke around with your arm or a
rod, smelling, feeling and looking for indications of trouble. Evidence of hot spots, warming, insect infestations or other problems that
start in the grain mass soon migrate to the
surface. Be particularly sensitive to damp, warm
or musty areas.
Safety
•	 Always think safety around grain bins.
• 	Wear appropriate masks when working around
dusts – particularly from moldy or spoiled grain.
Exposure to and inhaling mold can cause severe
allergic reactions.
•	 Never enter a bin when grain is being unloaded.
•	 Beware of crusted grain.
•	 It is best to work in pairs – one inside with a
safety harness and one outside to assist if needed.
•	 Grain suffocation accidents happen all too
often – think before you act or enter a bin!
These drying concepts and other details are
discussed in MP213, Grain Drying, available at
your local county Extension office. Corn drying is
not overly complicated, but does require a good
manager to maintain the highest corn quality.

10 - Grain Storage and

Aflatoxin in Corn

Dennis Gardisser, Gary Huitink and Rick Cartwright
Introduction
Arkansas farmers and grain dealers are
concerned with aflatoxin in corn. Aflatoxin is a
major problem for corn producers and handlers in
some years and only a minor problem in others.
This chapter describes aflatoxin, methods of
managing corn to reduce aflatoxin and remedial
treatments for contaminated corn.
What Is Aflatoxin?
Aflatoxin is a chemical produced by several
Aspergillus fungi, primarily Aspergillus flavus and
Aspergillus parasiticus, under certain conditions
when they grow in ears or on grain. These fungi
also cause ear rots, but their presence does not
always mean aflatoxin contamination.
Aflatoxin is most commonly found in corn,
peanuts, cottonseed and their processed products
and only rarely is noted in wheat, oats, sorghum,
rice and soybeans. Aflatoxin in the diet adversely
affects the growth and development of cattle, poultry,
swine, fish and other animals. Liver disease and
certain cancers have been associated with diets
containing aflatoxin in some animals. High levels of
aflatoxin can be lethal in all farm animals, but
young pigs, pregnant sows, calves and young
poultry are more susceptible than mature animals.
The Food and Drug Administration has
established “action levels,” measured in parts per
billion (ppb), for aflatoxin in animal feeds or food.
This makes animal feeds subject to regulatory action
if aflatoxins are detected above the following levels:
•	 300 ppb for corn intended for finishing (i.e.,
feedlot) beef cattle and for cottonseed meal
intended for beef cattle, swine or poultry;
•	 200 ppb for corn intended for finishing swine of
100 pounds or greater;
•	 100 ppb for corn intended for breeding beef
cattle, breeding swine or mature poultry;
•	 20 ppb for corn intended for human food,
immature animals (including immature poultry)
and for dairy animals, or when its destination is
not known;
•	 20 ppb for animal feeds other than corn or
cottonseed meal.
How Corn Is Contaminated with
Aspergillus sp.
Aspergillus overwinters primarily in plant debris
and litter on the soil. Spores of Aspergillus spp. are
airborne and fluctuate in number during the growing
season. Spores tend to increase during tillage and
harvest and may be further increased in dryland corn.
Infection of corn by Aspergillus spp. occurs
through the silk. The fungus appears to grow from
the ear tip toward the base by colonizing the silk
first, then the glumes and the kernel surface. After
the silks die, the growth of the fungus is rapid in
hot weather.
Factors influencing infection of corn ears by
Aspergillus spp. and aflatoxin contamination include
stress-related situations and insect damage. Corn
plants exposed to drought stress are more susceptible to infection and contamination by aflatoxin than
unstressed plants. Although insect damage is not
necessary for aflatoxin formation, the incidence of
Aspergillus and levels of aflatoxin contamination
can be higher in insect-damaged kernels.
79 
Prevention or Reduction of
Aflatoxin in Corn
If conditions are favorable for the production of
aflatoxin, it is much more difficult to prevent
infection from Aspergillus spp. and subsequent
aflatoxin production. Thus, a realistic goal is to
minimize the preharvest infection with sound agronomic practices and minimize post-harvest fungal
growth with careful handling and storage practices.
Since the fungus normally colonizes stressed,
cracked or broken kernels, reducing in-field stress
and kernel injury is recommended, including:
•	 Plant early to avoid drought stress and insect
damage. Corn may be planted successfully
when the morning soil temperature is 55˚F at a
2-inch depth for three consecutive days. This
normally occurs in late March in south
Arkansas and early April in north Arkansas.
Sometimes frost may occur after these planting
dates, but corn normally withstands frost with
very little injury.
•	 Irrigate properly to avoid drought stress.
Irrigation scheduling can prevent moisture stress
and protect yield potential by allowing uniform
kernel development. A computerized irrigation
scheduling program and a manual checkbook
program for scheduling irrigation are available
at county Extension offices. If tensiometers are
used to schedule irrigation, initiating irrigation at
50 centibars on silt loam and clay soils and
40 centibars on sandier soils is recommended.
•	 Plant Bt corn hybrids adapted to the south and
with good husk cover to minimize insect and
other stresses.
•	 Control late-season ear- and stalk-feeding
insects as needed.
•	 Harvest unstressed portions of fields separately
from portions of fields that suffered drought
stress (e.g., in a field irrigated with a center
pivot system, harvest inside the irrigated circle
first and leave the nonirrigated corners for
later). Mixing clean grain with moldy grain on
the truck is not recommended. The best
approach is to keep clean grain separate from
grain that is suspected to be contaminated.
•	 Research indicates the best kernel quality usually
results when corn is harvested within a range of
moisture levels between 19 and 24 percent. The
routine recommendation, based on
discounts/drying costs and field losses, is that
corn be harvested between 15 and 18 percent
moisture. This is an economic decision based on
a typical crop that has no increased risk for
lodging, charcoal rot or aflatoxin contamination.
If high-moisture corn can be dried rapidly,
at-risk fields should be harvested earlier, before they
reach 18 percent moisture. This reduces kernel
damage and the potential sites for aflatoxin contamination. High-moisture corn harvest also reduces
field loss, but it increases drying costs. To reduce
damage during combining:
•	 Use a rotary thresher, if available.
•	 Start with a thresher speed that is slow enough
to leave a few kernels on the cob. Don’t
overload the thresher or the cleaning sieves.
•	 Replace worn grain augers. Grain augers
damage kernels if their diameter is worn to the
point that kernels slip past the flighting.
•	 Adjust the combine airflow and sieve settings to
remove foreign material from the corn sample.
Separating foreign material from grain
eliminates a primary source of moisture and
material that restricts air movement in the bin.
Some broken kernel portions will blow over the
sieves and onto the field. Proper thresher
settings and post-harvest screen separators are
practical ways to eliminate broken kernel
portions. Start with the combine manufacturer’s
suggested settings and fine-tune the combine to
obtain a clean sample.
Eliminating fines is economically done with a
screen as grain is emptied from the truck hauling it
in from the field. This rotating screen fastens to the
grain auger and eliminates fine material. If these
80 
fines are contaminated with aflatoxin, they should
be burned or buried. Contaminated fines should
never be used for livestock feed. Clean combines,
grain carts, trucks, conveyors and bins thoroughly
after they have been used for corn.
Grain Storage to Preserve Quality
Many aflatoxin problems arise during grain
storage, which begins the moment the kernel enters
the grain tank on the combine. At that moment, the
quality of the grain is the best it will ever be. The
first objective in preserving grain quality is to
determine grain moisture level, amount of trash in
the grain, amount of grain damage that has occurred
and best utilization of facilities and manpower
available.
Grain that is cracked or has a lot of foreign
matter is susceptible to mold growth and is hard to
dry because of decreased airflow. The kernel seed
coat offers protection from invasion of a variety of
pests including insects and molds. Grain should be
handled carefully so as not to mechanically damage
the seed coat. Also, stress cracking due to overheating
or drying too rapidly should be avoided.
Air movement through grain helps avoid the
natural heating process that occurs with any material
containing high moisture. It is essential that grain
not be held in the field for any period of time to
avoid heat stress and fostering mold systems. If
possible, move grain to the drying and storage area
immediately after harvesting and begin to move air
through it to start the drying process. Ideally, move
grain to a drying operation in less than six hours
from the time it is harvested. A 24 hour delay may
cause problems, including high rates of Aspergillus
growth and aflatoxin production.
Relative humidity, kernel moisture and temperature
play a role in aflatoxin development on corn.
Conditions favoring the growth of A. flavus, include:
Factor Optimum
Temperature 80˚-100˚F
Relative Humidity 85%-100%
Kernel Moisture 18% and above
These factors act in combination. If the relative
humidity can be lowered with air movement and the
grain moisture is reduced, the potential of mold
problems decreases. Development of the fungus
usually stops when the temperature is below 55°F and
grain moisture is 12 percent or less, but it is greatly
reduced at moisture levels of 15 percent or less.
Store Grain at Low Moisture Content
The relationship between the moisture content
of stored grain and the relative humidity of the air
profoundly affects mold growth and grain spoilage.
The moisture content of stored grain determines the
relative humidity of the air in which it is stored.
High moisture content causes high relative humidity
in the air surrounding the grain in storage. Molds
grow rapidly when the air has a high relative
humidity and slowly at a low relative humidity. In
fact, each mold has a specific relative humidity
below which it will not grow. When grain is stored
with low moisture content, air contained in the grain
mass has low relative humidity and grain deterioration by mold growth is controlled. The best way to
control mold growth is to store grain with low
moisture content. The safe moisture storage level for
corn in Arkansas is approximately 12 to 13 percent.
Long-term storage should be 12 percent.
Avoid Pockets of Damp Grain
For safe storage, all the grain must be below
this safe storage moisture level. An isolated pocket
of damp grain supports mold and/or insect growth
which can spread upward and outward to drier
grain. A load of damp grain placed in storage with
dry grain limits the storage time of the entire lot to
that of the wettest grain. Research has shown that
even when damp and dry grain are carefully mixed
and moisture is allowed to equalize, moisture differences of 2 percent between kernels may remain.
When the grain is poorly mixed, much greater
differences result.
Pockets of high moisture can be the result of
adding a damp load to dry grain, even when mixed.
A column of fine and heavy foreign material often
accumulates under the filling spout creating a
trouble spot. Light trash, especially green trash,
81 
usually accumulates near the walls of storage bins
as it rides down the cone of grain during filling of
the bin. Don’t allow the incoming grain to cone
inside the bin. Any leaks in the storage bin also
cause pockets of high moisture grain.
Avoid Moisture Migration
A frequent cause of pockets of higher moisture
grain in storage is moisture migration. Grain in the
mid-south region is usually warm when harvested
and stored. Since grain is a good thermal insulator,
it remains warm until cooled by aeration. During
cold seasons, air near the bin wall cools, and
convective currents are set up in the bin. Warm air
in the center of the grain mass tends to rise and
absorb moisture due to its greater moisture carrying
capacity. As this air reaches the cool grain surface at
the top and center of the grain column, it is cooled
and gives up some of its moisture, which is
absorbed by the grain. This moisture migration
causes a pocket of higher moisture grain at the top
center of the stored grain. During the winter, this
process can cause a pocket of 18 to 20 percent
moisture in a bin of grain that was originally
uniformly 14 percent or lower. When the
temperature rises in the spring, moist grain may
germinate and storage mold will rapidly invade
the grain.
Moisture migration can be prevented by
aeration. Aeration during dry, cool days equalizes
temperatures within stored grain and prevents
convective currents.
Do Not Rely on Grain Turning
Turning grain (moving it from one bin to
another) is used by farmers in an attempt to prevent
or stop heating and deterioration. Research has
shown that turning does not make any important
reduction in average temperature or average moisture content of a bin of grain. Also, turning scatters
mold and insects throughout the bin. Only when
moisture content is uneven will turning be effective
in temporarily slowing heating and deterioration by
mixing damp grain with dry grain in the bin. Grain
turning should be considered a last resort to save a
deteriorating lot of grain. Aeration is more effective
for maintaining grain quality during storage, and
excessive handling increases kernel damage.
Control Insects and Rodents
Insects which invade stored grains are also
sensitive to temperature. Their growth and reproduction are greatly reduced at temperatures below 70°F
and cease at 50°F. Good housekeeping and spraying
operations are generally sufficient for control.
Rodents are controlled by storing grains in rodentproof bins. Both insect and rodent control are
enhanced by keeping grain facilities clean of old grain,
debris and vegetation. For details see fact sheets:
• 	Gardisser, D. R., 1989, Chemical Applicators
for Spraying Liquid Materials on Grain,
FSA-1006, University of Arkansas Cooperative
Extension Service.
• 	Gardisser, D. R., 1989, Calibration of Stored
Grain Chemical Applicators, FSA-1004,
University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension
Service.
Check Moisture Content During Storage
Anyone who stores grain should own or have
access to a grain moisture tester and know how to
use it properly. Calibrate the moisture tester before
each harvest season. It can be shipped to the manufacturer for calibration or checked against another
tester known to be accurate. When buying a
moisture tester, check with the manufacturer for the
best method of calibration.
When making moisture tests to determine the
condition of grain in storage, don’t enter a grain bin
without a safety harness and tether manned by at
least one adult outside the bin whose sole responsibility is aiding the entrant. Turn off all unloading
equipment and lock out electrical controls so no one
can unwittingly engage the power while you are
sampling the areas which are likely to have the
highest moisture content. Collect a sample near the
top center of the grain. Use a grain probe to collect
a representative sample from the area beneath the
fill-in spout where fine material tends to collect. If
the grain contained light trash that collected near the
82 
bin walls, sample these areas as well. Remember,
the wettest sample determines how well the grain
will keep.
To determine the average moisture content of
the grain, take three samples – one on top, one near
the center and one near the bottom. Openings in the
bin wall or a grain sampling probe are required.
Keep samples that will not be tested immediately
in airtight containers with as little air space as
possible left in the container. Metal cans or glass
jars with airtight lids or tight plastic bags are
suitable for holding samples.
Don’t test cold grain in a warm room. A thin
film of moisture may condense on the kernels and
cause erroneous readings. Either let the grain warm
up in a closed container or operate the tester in an
unheated room. Some electric moisture testers
require temperature corrections. In this case,
accurate temperature measurement is a must.
Check for Hot Spots During Storage
A “hot spot” in stored grain indicates activity or
mold growth. It may be due to a pocket of high
moisture grain or a collection of fine material
restricting aeration airflow. Temperature measurements in stored grain can detect “hot spots” before
they do serious damage.
Temperature readings can be made using a
probe consisting of a sensing element, probe handle
and meter. Sections can be coupled together to
check grain at depths up to 18 feet or more. If a
“hot spot” is detected, make several checks to
determine its size. Cool any “hot spots” as soon as
possible by aeration. If the hot spot is due to fine
material that is restricting airflow, break up the
“hot spot” by removing grain from the bottom of the
bin and returning it to the top.
Drying
Four commonly used drying systems include
natural air or low temperature, layer, batch-in-bin
and high temperature pass dryers. Drying air is
forced up through the grain mass in each of these
systems. Each system has advantages. Bin drying is
most practical for small volume producers. High
temperature drying is fastest but requires the
greatest amount of investment and energy input.
The top or outer layer is always the last to dry.
The drying layer moves up from the bottom so the
top layer of grain is held longer at conditions which
are ideal for aflatoxin production. Dry the top layer
to below 18 percent moisture quickly. Following are
some guidelines:
Initial Grain
Moisture Drying System
Above 20% High temperature batch,
continuous flow or batch-in-bin.
Below 20% Layer drying in bins with
supplemental heat (if needed) to
reduce the relative humidity of the
incoming air to 50% to 55% or
high temperature drying.
Below 16% Natural air drying when climatic
conditions permit or drying with
supplemental heat in bins during
the high relative humidity days.
Aerate as needed to control
temperature.
Equipment
•	 Use a properly sized fan to provide an adequate
amount of airflow through the grain. As the grain
depth in a bin increases, a larger fan is needed
because of the additional power needed to move
air through a column of grain. Also, higher moisture levels require more air to obtain a satisfactory drying level. The following table is a guide to
determine how much air movement is necessary
for safe drying at various moisture levels.
Moisture Level Minimum Airflow
(%) (CFM per Bushel)
11 to 13 0.5
13 to 15 1
15 to 18 2
18 to 20 3
20 to 22 4
22 and above 6
83 
•	 Equip all drying fans with heaters. Heaters are
necessary for 24-hour drying. During the nighttime hours, relative humidity increases and heat
is necessary to continue drying. Layer drying is
slow even with 24-hour operations. Checking
the relative humidity of the air manually or
using thermostat and humidistat controllers for
the heaters is necessary. (Controllers should be
checked manually to ensure they are working
correctly.)
•	 If you know the air temperature and relative
humidity, you can determine the equilibrium
moisture level of the air. If the moisture level of
the grain is higher than the air equilibrium
moisture level, drying occurs when air is moved
through the grain. The speed of drying is
determined by the difference between these
moisture levels and the amount of air moved.
The dryer the air and the larger the volume of
air moved through the grain, the faster the
drying process occurs.
•	 Bins should have adequate air exhaust in the
roof to avoid choking the fan. Any bin larger
than 2,500 bushels needs extra roof vents in
addition to the standard manhole (inspection
door) and the center fill hole. A good rule of
thumb for determining the number of square
feet of roof vent area needed is to multiply the
fan horsepower by 1.25. (Example: 20 horsepower fan multiplied by 1.25 = 25 ft2 of roof
vent area needed.)
•	 Level each layer of grain as it is placed in the
bin. Use a grain distributor to help level grain
and distribute any fines evenly across the
surface. Do not let the fines form a core in the
center of the bin.
•	 If the equilibrium moisture level of the drying
air is below that of the grain moisture, the
drying process should continue until the top
layer is dried to 13 percent. Air should be
conditioned as necessary during high humidity
swings to ensure that re-wetting of the bottom
layer does not occur.
•	 More details on grain drying may be obtained in
Extension publication MP-213, Grain Drying –
Using Psychometric and Moisture Equilibrium
Charts as Guides.
Storage Tips
•	 If grain is stored with uniform moisture contents
(maintained below 13 percent for corn), the
grain will store safely without spoilage.
•	 When grain is stored with moisture contents
above this safe level, reduce the grain temperature to inhibit mold development.
•	 For every combination of grain temperature and
moisture content above safe levels, there is an
allowable storage time before serious mold
growth develops. Lower temperatures and lower
moisture contents allow longer safe storage times.
•	 Moisture migration is caused by temperature
differentials in stored grain and is prevented by
aeration.
•	 Grains germinate when they are moist and
warm enough. They heat when invaded by
insects or storage molds.
•	 Be sure all old corn and trash are cleaned out of
the storage bin before any new corn is added.
•	 Clean bins and the plenum area, including below
the floor, and maintain the burners. Monitor the
drying process to avoid fire in a corn bin.
•	 Immediately after drying is completed, cool the
grain to outside air temperature.
• 	Treat corn while it is being placed into storage
to control insect infestations.
•	 Operate the fan whenever the outside air is
below 65 percent relative humidity and 10˚F
cooler than the corn until the corn reaches 50˚F.
•	 Operate fans for aeration at least 4 hours every
2 weeks after the corn is cooled to 50˚F.
•	 Consider fumigation if insect problems develop
in storage.
•	 Inspect corn frequently for mold, insects, hot
spots or other signs of spoilage. The best insurance for stored grain is frequent inspection!
84 
Detection of Aflatoxin
Most farms in Arkansas do not have high levels
of aflatoxin in corn, but occasionally grain has
enough aflatoxin to cause problems in marketing
and feeding. Farmers, elevator managers and feed
manufacturers need to be aware of proper detection
and identification of contaminated corn. Rapid
detection of contaminated corn is important because
aflatoxin normally survives processing and may be
concentrated in products or processed fractions.
Many elevators in Arkansas use a high intensity
ultraviolet light (UV) to detect a byproduct of
Aspergillus growth in grain or feed. Infected corn
emits a bright blue-green-yellow fluorescence when
exposed to UV light. However, the fluorescence only
indicates the presence of fungal activity and does
not prove the presence of aflatoxin. Many elevators
use a UV black light to screen grain samples.
Since the black light can result in false positives
for aflatoxin, the grain industry now generally use
ELISA test kits to directly detect aflatoxin in grain.
These test kits are based on an antibody specific for
aflatoxin. While these test kits are much more
accurate in trained hands than the black light, they
are only as representative as the sample collected
from the truck. Since aflatoxin-contaminated grain
is not randomly distributed in a truck load and since
even a single contaminated kernel in a sample can
cause the sample to exceed regulated levels of
aflatoxin, these tests still result in inaccurate readings
for the load, albeit the reading for the sample is
probably accurate.
A new state law in Arkansas requires the
Arkansas State Plant Board to investigate claims of
aflatoxin contamination in commercial grain, so any
grower receiving a positive result should contact the
Plant Board for help.
What Can Be Done with
Contaminated Grain?
Occasionally, corn may be contaminated with
aflatoxin at levels which disqualify it from normal
marketing channels. When loads of grain are
rejected for high aflatoxin, farmers and other users
have some remedial treatments or options for their
grain including:
•	 Blending aflatoxin-contaminated corn with
aflatoxin-free corn is not legal.
•	 Grain preservatives such as propionic acid,
isobutyric acid and other organic acids prevents
the growth of Aspergillus sp. if properly applied
to grain as it is augered into bins. However,
these acids will not lower levels of aflatoxin in
grain that is contaminated prior to treatment.
Furthermore, these materials are very corrosive
and should not be used in metal storage bins
unless the metal is protected. If grain treatments
are used, follow manufacturer’s recommendations carefully.
•	 Fumigating corn with anhydrous ammonia is an
effective means of detoxifying corn that could
not otherwise be fed to livestock. However, the
process is time-consuming and hazardous to
those ammoniating grain. The FDA has not yet
approved ammoniation as a process to salvage
aflatoxin contaminated corn. Anytime anhydrous
ammonia is used, all plumbing should meet
O.S.H.A. standards and eye protection should
be used.
•	 An activated clay, hydrated sodium calcium
aluminosilicate (HSCAS), may be added to
aflatoxin-contaminated feed to reduce the toxic
effects of aflatoxin in swine, poultry and cattle.
Some commercial products containing HSCAS
are registered as anti-caking materials and may
be added at labeled rates (0.5 to 2 percent of
finished feed) to animal feed. These products
appear to be the most cost effective method of
using contaminated grain for animal feed.
Summary
Aflatoxin can reduce the quality and
marketability of corn. Contamination can originate
in the field and increase dramatically during grain
storage. Proper management of the crop, careful
handling and proper storage of the grain are critical
in preventing aflatoxin. Once contaminated, affected
corn is very difficult to deal with.

11 - Estimating Production Costs for

Corn in Arkansas

Tony Windham
Corn production cost estimates are published
each year by the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service. The most recent edition of
these publications can be located on the Cooperative
Extension Service web site at:
http://www.aragriculture.org/farmplanning/
Budgets/default.asp
Enterprise budgets represent a type of
information that can be used by a wide variety of
individuals in making decisions in the agricultural
industry. They are used:
•	 by farmers for planning,
•	 by Extension personnel in providing educational
programs to farmers,
•	 by lenders as a basis for credit,
•	 to provide basic data for research and
•	 to inform non-farmers of the costs incurred by
farmers in the production of food and fiber
crops.
The purpose of these publications is to provide
a systematic procedure for estimating the cost of
producing corn. Users of this information should
think of these budgets as a first approximation and
then make appropriate adjustments using the
“YOUR FARM” column provided on each budget
to add, delete or change costs to reflect the specific
situations. For example, each of these corn
enterprise budgets includes an estimated drying
cost. Many producers believe this cost can be
reduced by allowing the crop to dry in the field
prior to harvest. However, since these estimates are
intended to be a planning guide, drying costs are
included which allows the user the opportunity to
make adjustments.
Each budget estimates the direct and fixed
expenses associated with producing corn. Input
price data used in estimating direct costs are
updated annually by obtaining prices from farm
input suppliers throughout the crop’s production
area. Quantities of inputs are based on the
recommendations of Extension and Research faculty
within the Division of Agriculture. Data obtained
from the Corn Research Verification Program is also
used in developing these estimates.
Fixed expenses include depreciation, interest,
taxes and insurance and represent an average cost
allocated over the entire useful life of the
machinery. Various financing arrangements and tax
depreciation methods can produce costs that vary
significantly from these estimates in a given year.
The ability to estimate the actual cost is a complex
economic procedure whereby cash accounting and
economic costs may vary greatly.
Each budget also includes a sequential listing of
all operations used in the estimation procedure. This
information can be used to determine the cost of a
specific tillage operation, pesticide application or
irrigation practice. The user can also compare the
number of tillage operations or irrigations with their
own expectations.

12 - Identify Hazards and

Prevent Accidents

Gary Huitink, Phil Tacker and Earl Vories
Injury and death rates in almost every survey
published are higher from April to September for
agricultural work. Obviously, these months coincide
with corn production. What can be done on your
farm to prevent the trauma and cost of severe injury
or death? Top managers maintain timely crop
practices and also place a consistent emphasis on
reducing field, traffic and shop hazards in day-today management.
Have a Plan to Reduce Hazards
One approach is to set long-range goals to
eliminate hazards while finding safer ways to
complete routine tasks. Assess the potential kinds of
severe accidents and how frequently a person is
exposed to that hazard. Develop a simple plan that
you can follow to minimize these exposures.
Serious concern should be given to the risks of road
collision, tractor overturn and a person being run
over or crushed by farm equipment. Consider all
aspects of your farming operation to identify
weaknesses, and then seek remedies.
If a person must work alone, make sure another
person knows where the lone worker is and that
regular contact is made. If a lone operator sees a
hazardous situation, getting help to resolve it is
essential. Everyone should be trained to contact the
manager immediately about any serious safety
concern.
Field
A few field dangers cause many Arkansas
fatalities. These are tractor overturns, equipment
running over victims and crushing them, jumpstarting tractors, hitching equipment or folding
equipment for road travel.
Most tractors used for corn production have a
Roll-Over Protective Structure (ROPS). It has been
well documented that the risk of serious injury from
Table 12-1. Factors Involved in Agricultural
Fatalities (1996 National Safety Council data)
Tractors 37%
All other agricultural machinery 17%
Farm trucks or other vehicles 11%
Animals 6%
All other fatalities 29%
an overturn is essentially zero if the operator fastens
his seat belt on a tractor equipped with ROPS!
Practicing this safety habit may also reduce injury
from a traffic collision. Operating a tractor, sprayer
or combine too fast for conditions causes many
overturns. Turning too short can cause an overturn.
Misjudging your distance from an embankment can
be serious, because the bank may crumble under the
weight of the tractor or implement. FSA-1026,
Safe Tractor Operation, available from your county
Extension office, has more suggestions that may be
useful for training farm help.
Whether calibrating a planter or sprayer or
moving a combine, don’t move equipment until you
see that everyone is out of danger. Starting a tractor
in gear from the starter terminal (jump-starting) is
possibly the most common reason Arkansans have
been run over. Transmission interlocks prevent
tractors from starting in gear, unless the safety is
bypassed. A victim doesn’t have enough time to
jump away from a tractor left in gear before the
engine builds hydraulic pressure and the tractor rolls
over him.
Whenever noise prevents you from hearing
someone, stop the engine and what you’re doing and
move where you can talk to clear up any confusion.
Hand signals are easily misunderstood, unless both
of you understand the meaning of a hand movement
in advance. It takes good communication and
89 
cooperation for two people to safely hitch heavy
toolbars or towed implements. Make sure signals
aren’t confusing before moving the tractor to align
the connection.
Using a proper hitch support may prevent a
dangerous hitching incident. If the hitch or lift pins
do not align, movement may knock the support
from under equipment; the toolbar or hitch may
spring out of control or drop and crush someone’s
foot. Two severe accidents in 2002 may be instructive: One employee was killed trying to remove a
pin when the hitch broke free and smashed his face.
Another victim removed a latch pin and was
crushed by a folding cultivator; the hydraulic
cylinder didn’t support the weight. If supports aren’t
sturdy, stable and at the proper height when disconnecting an implement, difficulty is likely when
hitching the next time. Set the safety locks on the
lift cylinders before working under a combine
header. Never work under hydraulic lifts, mowers or
toolbars without sturdy supports.
Combine entanglements don’t usually happen
the first time a row unit plugs. It’s the fourth or fifth
time, or later, when you’re tired or irritated, in a
hurry and your judgment lapses. Vibration and
excessive noise dull an alert person’s senses to
hazards. Fatigue also slows your reaction, so take
breaks for refreshment. Falls from combines, grain
bins, etc., may be prevented with proper work
platforms or sturdy ladders. Keep work areas neat
and free of hose or electric cord loops, etc., which
could pose trip hazards.
Professionals mount large implement tires with
a protective cage. Mishaps while inflating tires can
maim or kill. If you don’t have equipment to handle
tires safely, it is wiser to call a tire service company.
Irrigation risers, discharge pipes and “washout”
holes where water discharges may become hazards
if they are not clearly visible. If field equipment hits
a riser or washout, it could cause temporary loss of
control in addition to damaging the equipment
and/or the riser. Placing some type of readily visible
marker at each riser and controlling weeds so they
don’t hide the marker should alert drivers. Anchor
and guy wires from power poles located near or in
fields should also be permanently marked. Putting
some type of solid protection around guy wires for
power poles is a good idea to help avoid clipping or
dislodging them with field equipment. Fill washout
holes and use some erosion control structure or method
to prevent large washouts under discharge pipes.
Agricultural aviators have little reaction time to
dodge hazards as they apply fertilizer and
pesticides. Always warn the pilot of any risks that
you’re aware of to help him be better prepared. If a
field has aerial hazards, consider whether it would
be more appropriate to use ground equipment.
Traffic and Road Transport
The National Highway Traffic Safety
Association recently reported that approximately
40 percent more fatal crashes and fatalities occur
in rural compared to urban areas. Experience
over the last four years in crop areas of Arkansas
seems to reinforce national statistics. Changes like
wider road shoulders, adding warning signs for
curves with poor visibility, updating narrow bridges
and, possibly, adding crossbars at railroad crossings
should reduce rural traffic accidents. In some
situations it may be possible to convince the town,
county, state or railroad to clear a right-of-way to
obtain better traffic visibility.
Modern toolbars, combines and wide equipment
typically require almost two normal traffic lanes.
Motorists are often poor judges of the slow speed,
width or weight of your implement, regardless of
what you’re transporting. Using an escort with
flashing lights is probably the best way to alert a
motorist. Being diligent to keep SMV signs,
reflectors and taillights bright, cleaning them before
entering a road, will improve their visibility during
night and day.
Lock both of your brakes together and start onto
a road slowly, even when traffic is heavy. Go slowly
enough to manage the momentum of a tractor with a
full grain cart, planter or toolbar, especially those
that raise overhead. Dump all of the corn from your
combine bin into a grain cart or truck prior to road
travel to lower the center of gravity and gain control
in a sudden emergency. Always check traffic from
both directions before making a turn off a road,
especially a left turn, to prevent a collision and
extensive damage, if not injury.
Railroad crossings are increasingly dangerous for
growers on farm equipment. Some cabs may “tune
90 
out” the diesel train noise. In order to hear better,
reduce the speed of the cab fan and turn off the
radio as you approach a crossing. If you gear down
well in advance, you can control the load, either to
stop or to proceed when the track is clear. In some
cases, either historical evidence and/or community
effort may help to get the railroad to add crossbars.
General Precautions
Work can be done safely on equipment powered
by electricity with a “lock-out, tag-out” approach.
Anyone working with equipment powered by
electricity should carry a lock with his personal key
and tag. These are readily available from local
electrical suppliers. Before starting work, always
disconnect the power supply and lock the switch
“off.” If you’re interrupted by a phone call, or are
not visible from the switchbox, no one else can
reconnect the electricity. You can remove the lock
from the switch lever after completing the work.
Always use the heel of your left hand to throw lever
switches and turn your face away as you move the
control to minimize bad flash-fire burns.
Figure 12-1. Proper method to safely bump or switch
a disconnect lever on an electrical box.
A federal regulation intended for your personal
safety prohibits anyone or any equipment from
coming within 10 feet of an overhead power line. If
field equipment or other traffic cannot maintain a
10-foot gap under the power line, request that your
power supplier raise the power lines.
Diesel-powered generators, electric-powered
pressure washers and hand tools (drill, angle
grinder, etc.) and welders should all be adequately
grounded. Grinders, drills and other electric tools
bouncing around in a truck tool box can develop
“shorts.” If the electric service entrance at the shop
is grounded with an 8-foot ground rod (National
Electric Code standard), all ground wire leads,
including the extra grounding plug on power cords,
should be connected to reduce the risk of electrocution when a short occurs. Use electric tools on dry
soil, concrete, etc., to reduce the potential of a fatal
current surge passing through your body.
Someone, maybe several people on your farm,
should keep current on CPR rescue techniques. The
local EMT, ambulance and fire department numbers
should be posted by every permanent phone and
programmed on “speed dials.” Each one on the farm
should be prepared to call emergency rescue, should
an accident occur.
Observe pesticide labels for proper use, mixing
and disposal. Appropriate personal protective
equipment is specified on the label. The label and
the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) should have
specific inhalation, dermal, ingestion and emergency
information. If a mishap occurs, use the label to
help your physician and the poison center to start
the proper treatment.
Fire extinguishers on tractors and combines may
also protect your safety and equipment investment.
Dry chemical all-purpose 3A-40B:C or 4A-80B:C
extinguishers are good choices for tractors and
combines. Once a fire extinguisher is 10 years old,
it is generally wise to replace it unless it exceeds
requirements in a thorough test.
Irrigation
A qualified electrician should routinely check
electrical circuits on irrigation pumps and centerpivot systems. Items to review are proper grounding
and adequate circuit protection, including immediate
replacement of circuit boxes damaged by electrical
storms or circuit overheating. If a box has overheated or shorted, switching the disconnect may
cause arcing and severe flash burns that may take
months for merely partial recuperation. Always use
the heel of your left hand to throw switch levers and
turn your face away to minimize your hazard
exposure as you move the control.
91 
Be cautious when working around electrical
circuits, especially when opening electric control
boxes and around any circuits that are “hot.” Wasps
commonly nest in and around electric control boxes
and may also appear from electric motor shrouds,
gear head covers, power unit platforms, irrigation
well sheds and irrigation pipe openings. In order to
prevent an injury, it may be wise to keep wasp and
hornet spray handy when working on irrigation
wells. Stings are not only painful; they can be fatal
for one who is severely allergic to insect stings.
Further injury can also occur if a wasp startles you
and causes you to jump back. A sudden reaction that
puts you in contact with an unguarded drive or an
energized electric circuit may cause permanent
disability.
Entanglements may occur with irrigation well
power shafts, if safety shields aren’t replaced. In
general, power-take-off (PTO) hazards are respected,
but more emphasis needs to be placed on shielding
unguarded power shafts on irrigation wells. Power
shaft covers can be obtained from suppliers, including Menard Mfg. in DeWitt, AR (1-888-764-3130)
to protect those doing maintenance around diesel,
propane or electric power units. Power shafts for
relifts or well pumps should be shielded; any
concentric sleeves that don’t spin free should be
repaired or replaced.
Figure 12-2. Install shields to protect anyone working
around well power shafts.
If a power unit is not securely mounted and
anchored, vibration may misalign the drive or break
it loose from the supports. A loose power unit may
cause a dangerous flailing power shaft or other
hazards due to broken electrical wires, fuel lines or
battery cables. Power units and battery mounts
should be securely anchored to a substantial support
platform and routinely checked for stability. A
secure latch to keep the clutch of the power unit in
neutral is a good safety device. This can help
prevent accidentally bumping and engaging the
clutch when working close to the power unit.
Typically, weather is very hot when irrigation is
needed, and physical stresses may bring on heat
stress. Anyone working in these conditions should
drink plenty of fluids such as water and nutrientreplenishing drinks. Breaks and rest periods should
be taken as needed to avoid heat stress, fatigue and
exhaustion. Fatigue and exhaustion, of themselves,
are health hazards, but they may also contribute to
poor judgment, causing other accidents and injuries.
Reservoirs and open irrigation distribution
ditches may present concerns. Normally, a clear
warning on a sign about the water hazard, unusual
currents around culverts, etc., and potential bank
washouts will caution outdoorsmen or others who
may enter. Evaluate a location with respect to
residences or public access to determine whether it
may attract youngsters. Gates and fencing may be
used around accessible areas to prevent ATV riders
or children from getting into danger. Posting no
trespassing signs or a drowning warning is primarily
useful only for adults.
Grain Drying
The primary grain-handling hazard is
entanglement, but the potential for both suffocation
under flowing grain and electrocution should also be
reviewed. Certainly, all auger covers should be in
place every time the power is engaged. In addition,
don’t reach across belt drives or power shafts; take
the time needed to walk around your tractor or
power unit. Fans and drives should be shielded to
prevent anyone from getting caught. Children
shouldn’t be around grain handling facilities; fencing the area may be a practical choice.
A qualified electrician should routinely check
electric circuits to confirm proper grounding and
92 
adequate circuit protection, including making
immediate repairs of faulty wiring, conduits or
control panels. Disconnect electric power and use
the lock-out, tag-out procedure every time before
beginning work around an auger, fan, motor or
powered component. Before tilting truck beds,
moving augers or tall equipment, check for overhead power lines; too many times an auger is raised
or pulled into a bare overhead wire. When grain
bins are built or facilities are remodeled, power
lines should be routed well away from any work
areas so accidental contact with wires isn’t possible.
Before entering a grain bin, put on a NIOSHapproved toxic dust respirator for molds and dust to
prevent a reaction called farmer’s lung or toxic
organic dust syndrome. Turn off all unloading
equipment and lock out switches with a padlock
before entering a bin so that someone doesn’t
unwittingly engage the power. This applies to all
loading auger, sweep auger, stirring auger and
unloading auger circuits. Don’t enter a grain bin
without a safety harness and tether manned by at
least one adult outside the bin whose sole responsibility is aiding the entrant. Crusted grain has been a
factor in a number of deaths to growers. Spoiled or
caked corn may “cave in” onto a man if the crust
suddenly fractures. If some corn is removed from a
bin with a crusted surface, the undermined surface
may suddenly collapse under your foot, releasing an
“avalanche” of corn. More than 500 pounds of pull
are required to move a man who is covered with
corn to his shoulders. If you’re covered, you can’t
get yourself out and you’re likely to suffocate if no
one is watching. More details are included in
FSA-1010, Suffocation Hazards in Grain Bins.
OSHA
Only farms with 11 or more employees are
required to meet all OSHA labor regulations. All
growers, however, are to comply with these standards:
1)	 Roll-over protective structure (ROPS)
2)	 Slow moving vehicle emblem (SMV)
3)	 Agricultural machinery guarding (of moving
parts, i.e., PTOs, combine safety shields, auger
inlet covers and other moving machinery
guards)
4)	 Anhydrous ammonia standards
5)	 Temporary labor camps standards
6)	 Pulpwood logging standards
7)	 Hazard communication (right to know). If you
are an employer and store farm diesel fuel,
pesticides, etc., then labels, MSDS, information,
training and a written Hazard Communication
Program are required.
If your farm is under OSHA jurisdiction, OSHA
requires reporting an accident within 8 hours. They
define a reportable incident as hospitalization of
three or more employees in one accident or a death
of one or more employees. A Washington, D.C.,
phone number, 1-800-321-6742, is available
24 hours a day. You can report to the federal OSHA
office in Little Rock during working hours at
501-324-6291, extension 235.
If an OSHA officer requests admittance to a
workplace, an employer may deny it. The officer
can, however, obtain a search warrant. The inspection should include only the immediate accident
scene. Inspections may result in setting a penalty or
formal warnings, with penalties enforced later (often
30 days), if the hazard isn’t remedied. Inspectors
can ask that employees be removed from areas of
imminent danger. An owner can appeal to the federal
OSHA office in Little Rock, phone 501-324-6291,
extension 235.
Other considerations that may be important:
1)	 When is a CDL operator’s license required?
2)	 What training should be provided for all
employees and others? Training at the time of
employment, as tasks are assigned, and at
minimum, every year, instructs every employee
on farm hazards and on safe operation. Keeping
signed records is the best way to document
training and record your progress removing
farm hazards, should a major injury or death
occur on your farm.
3)	 Are 14-15 year-olds employed? Training for
hazardous machinery operation is specified and
work criteria apply to those under 18 who are
employed in agriculture.
93 
4)	 Are your insurance policy liability limits and
deductibles appropriate for your present farm?
5)	 Have you considered whether workmen’s
compensation is feasible?
6)	 Are employment procedures for non-citizens
applicable?
Summary
These suggestions are a start to help you
manage hazards and find ways to avoid them.
These hazards are only highlights. Review your
techniques and farm work sites in order to
reduce potential hazards.
A grower’s leadership is the key to influencing
employees and others on the farm. Employees must
know that working safely is expected, for their
welfare, as well as that of their employer. During
the non-crop season, it is wise to make a careful
hazard audit. Review the previous season’s activities
and field records to bring to mind hazards or
incidents, especially considering situations when
someone narrowly avoided serious injury. Making
changes may save someone’s life the next season.
In most situations, equipment isn’t the
underlying cause of an accident. A single thoughtless reaction can make you a victim. Never get in a
hurry. Plan ahead to ensure there is enough time to
do the job properly and safely.

13 - Renewable Energy

Dennis R. Gardisser
The United States is overly dependent on
foreign oil. Using corn as a renewable resource
reduces this dependency and provides an alternative
use for our farm products. As corn acreage increases
in Arkansas, so will opportunities to use corn as a
renewable resource in the area.
Corn Products1
Corn refiners use shelled corn which has been
stripped from the cob during harvesting. Refiners
separate the corn into its components – starch, oil,
protein and fiber – and convert them into higher
value products.
Corn sweeteners (http://www.corn.org/web/
sweeten.htm) are the most important refined corn
products. Last year, corn sweeteners supplied more
than 56 percent of the U.S. nutritive sweetener market.
The second major refined corn product is
ethanol (http://www.corn.org/web/ethanol.htm)
which is gaining increasing acceptance as a cleaner
burning option for motor fuels. The ethanol industry
continues on its record production pace. When
2002 is over, the United States ethanol industry
will have produced over 2 billion gallons of high
octane, American-made ethanol. That’s 2 billion
gallons of fuel that we didn’t have to import from
the Middle East.2
The third major corn product – a mainstay of
the industry and of the U.S. economy – is Starch
(http://www.corn.org/web/starch.htm). Americans
rely on corn refiners for over 90 percent of their
starch needs.
Corn refining is America’s premier bioproducts
(http://www.corn.org/web/bioprod.htm) industry,
with increasing production of amino acids,
antibiotics and degradable plastics adding further
value to the U.S. corn crop.
In addition to starches, sweeteners and ethanol –
all made from the starch portion of the corn – refiners
produce corn oil (http://www.corn.org/web/cornoil.
htm) and a variety of important feed products
(http://www.corn.org/web/feed.htm).
Ethanol Information3
Consumer Benefits
U.S. consumers use more than 18 billion gallons
of high performance, cleaner burning ethanolblended gasoline each year.
•	 Ethanol increases oxygenate supplies, reducing
the need for MTBE, methyl tertiary butyl ether,
imports and helping to reduce consumer costs.
•	 Ethanol is a high-octane blending component
used by many gasoline marketers – helping to
keep this important class of trade viable and
creating competition for the major oil companies.
•	 Since the petroleum refining industry is running
at near capacity, the ethanol industry helps
extend our petroleum supply, thereby helping
moderate fuels costs to consumers.
Taxpayer Benefits
•	 The partial excise tax exemption available to
gasoline marketers for ethanol and ETBE blends
saves money. A General Accounting Office
(GAO) study has shown that reduced farm
program costs and increased income tax
revenues offset the cost of the incentive.
1http://www.corn.org/web/products.htm; 2http://www.ethanol.org - American Coalition for Ethanol;
3www.ethanol.org/information/ethanol_information.htm
95 
•	 The economic activity attributable to the ethanol
industry will generate $3.5 billion in additional
income tax revenue over the next five years –
$1 billion more than the cost of the exemption.
The U.S. ethanol industry will create a net gain
to the taxpayers of almost $4 billion over the
next five years.
Economic Benefits
•	 More than $3 billion has been invested in
60 ethanol production facilities operating in
20 states across the country.
•	 The ethanol industry is responsible for more
than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, creating
more than $1.3 billion in increased household
income annually, and more than $12.6 billion
over the next five years.
•	 The ethanol industry directly and indirectly adds
more than $6 billion to the American economy
each year.
•	 The demand for grain created by ethanol
production increases net farm income more
than $12 billion annually.
•	 As the economic activity created by the ethanol
industry rippled throughout the economy, it
generated $30 billion in final demand between
1996 and 2000.
•	 Increases in ethanol production offer enormous
potential for economic growth in small rural
communities. USDA has estimated that a
100 million gallon ethanol plant could create
2,250 local jobs.
Agricultural Benefits
•	 Industrial corn use, which includes ethanol and
sweetener production, is now the second largest
consumer of corn in America. Each $1 of
upstream and on-farm economic activity
generates $3.20 in downstream economic
stimulus attributable to ethanol processing,
compared to just $0.31 when corn is exported.
•	 Ethanol production consumed 535 million
bushels of corn in 1994 (5.3 percent of the
record 10 billion bushel corn crop). About
667 million bushels of corn were used for
ethanol in 2001.
•	 The demand for corn created by the ethanol
industry increases crop values – accounting for
approximately $0.14 of the value of every
bushel of corn sold, or $1.4 billion.
•	 If the market for ethanol did not exist, corn
stocks would rise and net income to American
corn farmers would be reduced by $6 billion
over the next five years, or about 11 percent.
•	 Many farmers now own and operate ethanol
plants, allowing them to add value to their
own corn.
Energy/Trade Benefits
•	 Domestic ethanol production reduces demand
for imported oil and imported MTBE which
drain our economy. Oil and MTBE imports now
represent almost 80 percent of the U.S. trade
deficit.
•	 Currently, imported oil accounts for about
56 percent of oil used, and imported MTBE is at
a record 31 percent of domestic production.
• 	Today, ethanol reduces the demand for gasoline
and MTBE imports by 98,000 barrels per day.
A 98,000 barrel/day replacement of imported
MTBE would represent a $1.1 billion reduction
to our annual trade deficit.
•	 Ethanol production also generates exports of
feed co-products, such as corn gluten, further
enhancing our balance of trade.
•	 Ethanol production is extremely energy
efficient, with a positive energy balance of
125 percent, compared to 85 percent for
gasoline. Ethanol production is by far the most
efficient method of producing liquid transportation fuels. According to USDA, each Btu used
to produce a Btu of gasoline could be used to
produce 8 Btus of ethanol.
96 
Environmental Benefits
•	 10-percent ethanol blends reduce carbon
monoxide better than any other reformulated
gasoline blend, more than 25 percent.
•	 Ethanol is low in reactivity and high in oxygen
content, making it an effective tool in reducing
ozone pollution.
•	 Ethanol is a safe replacement for toxic octane
enhancers in gasoline such as benzene, toluene
and xylene.
•	 Oil companies are now starting to acknowledge
the environmental and energy benefits of
ethanol. For example, see the brochure
published by Mobil.
The information contained in this chapter is
intended to be an awareness introduction to the
many possibilities available to use corn as a
renewable resource. The internet is an excellent
resource for additional contacts and information on
this topic. Search engines for renewable resources,
ethanol, alternative fuels, corn byproducts and
others will uncover a wealth of data.
