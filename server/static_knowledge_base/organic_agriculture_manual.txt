1. INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Organic agriculture is an integrated production management system which promotes and enhances
agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity (FAO/WHO
Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2007). It emphasizes the use of natural inputs (i.e. mineral and
products derived from plants) and the renunciation of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
Organic agriculture follows the principles and logic of a living organism, in which all elements (soil,
plant, farm animals, insects, the farmer and local conditions) are closely linked to each other. This is
accomplished by using, where possible, agronomic, biological and mechanical methods, following the
principles of these interactions, using natural ecosystem as a model (Figure 1).
FIGURE 1-1 - USING NATURAL ECOSYSTEM AS A MODEL
Organic agriculture shares many techniques used by other sustainable agricultural approaches (e.g.
intercropping, crop rotation, mulching, integration of crops and livestock). However, the use of natural
inputs (non synthetic), the improvement of soil structure and fertility and the use of a crop rotation
plan represent the basic rules that make organic agriculture a unique agricultural management system.
According with the Guidelines of Organically Food Produce of the Codex Alimentarius (2007), an
organic production system is designed to:
 Enhance biological diversity within the whole system;
 Increase soil biological activity;
 Maintain long-term soil fertility;
 Recycle wastes of plant and animal origin in order to return nutrients to the soil, thus minimizing
the use of non-renewable resources;
 Rely on renewable resources in locally organized agricultural systems;
 Promote the healthy use of soil, water and air as well as minimize all forms of pollution that may
result from agricultural practices;
 Promote the careful processing methods agricultural products in order to maintain the organic
integrity and vital qualities of the product at all stages;
 Become established on any existing farm through a period of conversion, the appropriate length
of which is determined by site-specific factors such as the history of the land, and type of crops
and livestock to be produced.
In addition, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), a nongovernmental organization internationally networking and promoting organic agriculture, has
SUMMARY
7
established guidelines that have been widely adopted by the organic community for organic
production and processing.
FIGURE 1-2 -OVERVIEW OF ORGANIC PRODUCTION IN 2003: HECTARES UNDER CERTIFIED ORGANIC MANAGEMENT IN THE DIFFERENT
CONTINENT (SOURCE: SOEL STATISTIC, 2003)
According with IFOAM (2002), the organic agriculture practices are based on the following principles:
 Principle of health: the role of organic agriculture, whether in farming, processing,
distribution, or consumption, is to sustain and enhance the health of ecosystems and
organisms from the smallest in the soil to human beings. In view of this, it should avoid the
use of fertilizers, pesticides, animal drugs and food additives that may have adverse health
effects.
 Principle of ecology: organic agriculture should be based on living ecological systems and
cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustaining them. Organic management must
be adapted to local conditions, ecology, culture and scale. The reduction of inputs by reuse,
recycle and the efficient management of materials and energy will contribute to improve
environmental quality and will conserve resources.
 Principle of fairness: This principle emphasizes that those involved in organic agriculture
should conduct human relationships in a manner that ensures fairness at all levels and to all
parties – farmers, workers, processors, distributors, traders and consumers. It also insists that
animals should be provided with the conditions and opportunities of life according with their
physiology, natural behaviour and well-being. Natural and environmental resources that are
used for production and consumption should be managed in a socially and ecologically fair
way and should be held in trust for future generations. Fairness requires systems of
production, distribution and trade that are open and equitable and account for real
environmental and social costs.
 Principle of Care: This principle states that precaution and responsibility are the key
concerns in management, development and technology choices in organic agriculture. Science
is necessary to ensure that organic agriculture is healthy, safe and ecologically sound.
However, it must consider valid solutions from practical experiences, accumulated traditional
and indigenous knowledge and prevent significant risks by adopting appropriate technologies
and rejecting unpredictable ones, such as genetic engineering.
8
The goal of organic agriculture is to contribute to the enhancement of sustainability. But what does
sustainability mean? In the context of agriculture, sustainability refers to the successful management
of agricultural resources to satisfy human needs while at the same time maintaining or enhancing the
quality of the environment and conserving natural resources for future generations. Sustainability in
organic farming must therefore be seen in a holistic sense, which includes ecological, economic and
social aspects.
FIGURE 1-3 - THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY
Only if the three dimensions are fulfilled an agricultural system can be called sustainable.
The organic agriculture techniques are known to be by:
 Improving soil structure and fertility through the use of crop rotations, organic manure, mulches
and the use of fodder legumes for adding nitrogen to the soil fertility cycle.
 Prevention of soil erosion and compaction by protecting the soil planting mixed and relay crops.
 Promotion of biological diversity through the use of natural pest controls (e.g. biological control,
plants with pest control properties) rather than synthetic pesticides which, when misused, are
known to kill beneficial organisms (e.g. natural parasites of pests, bees, earthworms), cause pest
resistance, and often pollute water and land.
 Performing crop rotations, which encourage a diversity of food crops, fodder and under-utilized
plants; this, in addition to improving overall farm production and fertility, may assist the onfarm conservation of plant genetic resources.
 Recycling the nutrients by using crop residues (straws, stovers and other non-edible parts)
either directly as compost and mulch or through livestock as farmyard manure.
 Using renewable energies, by integration of livestock, tree crops and on farm forestry into the
system. This adds income through organic meat, eggs and dairy products, as well as draught
animal power. Tree crops and on-farm forestry integrated into the system provide food, income,
fuel and wood.
Sustainability is also about equity among and between generations. Organic agriculture contributes to
the social well-being by reducing the losses of arable soil, water contamination, biodiversity erosion,
GHG emissions, food losses, and pesticide poisoning.
Organic agriculture is based on traditional knowledge and culture. Its farming methods evolve to
match local environments, responding to unique biophysical and socio economics constraints and 
9
opportunities. By using local resources, local knowledge, connecting farmers, consumers and their
markets, the economic conditions and the development of rural can be improved.
Organic agriculture stresses diversification and adaptive management to increase farm productivity,
decrease vulnerability to weather vagaries, and consequently improves food security, either with the
food the farmers produce or the income from the products they sell.
Organic farming appears to generate 30% more employment in rural areas and labor achieves higher
returns per unit of labor input. By using local resources better, organic agriculture facilitates
smallholders’ access to markets and thus income generation; and relocalizes food production in
market-marginalized areas.
Generally, organic yields are 20% less as compared to high-input systems in developed countries but
could be up to 180% higher as compared to low-input systems in arid/semi-arid areas. In humid areas,
rice paddy yields are equal, while the productivity of the main crop is reduced for perennials, though
agroforestry provides additional goods.
Operating costs (seeds, rent, repairs and labor) in organic agriculture are significantly lower than
conventional production, ranging from 50-60% for cereals and legumes, to 20-25% for dairy cows and
10-20% for horticulture products. This is due to lower input costs on synthetic inputs, lower irrigation
costs, and labor cash costs that include both family labor and hired workers. Total costs are, however,
only slightly lower than conventional, as fixed costs (such as land, buildings and machinery) increase
due to new investments during conversion (e.g. new orchards, animal houses) and certification.
The demand for organic products creates new export opportunities. Organic exports are sold at
impressive premiums, often at prices 20% higher than the same products produced on non-organic
farms. Under the right circumstances the market returns from organic agriculture can potentially
contribute to local food security by increasing family incomes.
Entering this lucrative market is not easy. Farmers require hiring an organic certification organization
to annually inspect and confirm that their farms and businesses adhere to the organic standards
established by various trading partners. During the conversion period to organic management, which
lasts 2 to 3 years, farmers cannot sell their produce as “organic” and thus, tap price premiums. This is
because consumers expect organic produce to be free of residues. However, according to the Codex
Guidelines on Organically Produced Food (2007), products produced on land under organic
management for at least one year, but less than the two-three year requirement could be sold as
“transition to organic”; but very few markets have developed for such products.
10
FIGURE 1-4 - DEFINITION OF SOME FARMING SYSTEMS: THIS SHOWS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SOME COMMONLY USED TERMS OF
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS (ARROW SHOW HOW THEY CAN TRANSFORM FROM ONE TYPE INTO ANOTHER)
While most developing countries producers have historically targeted international export markets in
the EU and North America, domestic market opportunities for organic food are emerging worldwide.
Acknowledging the role of domestic organic markets in supporting a vibrant organic sector,
alternative systems to certification have emerged worldwide. In developed countries, consumers and
organic producers have built direct channels for home delivery of non-certified organic produce (e.g.
Community Supported Agriculture). In the United States of America (USA), farmers marketing small
quantities of organic products are formally exempt from certification. Increasingly in developing
countries, Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) are recognized as substitute to third part
certification (e.g. India, Brazil, Pacific islands).
More recently, organic agriculture has become an option to improve household food security, or to
achieve a reduction of input costs. With the economic crisis, this phenomenon is seen also in
developed countries. Produce is used by farmers for their own consumption or it is sold on the market
without a price distinction as it is not certified.
Economic objectives are not the only motivation of organic farmers; the goals are often to optimize
land, animal and plant interactions, preserve natural nutrient and energy flows and enhance
biodiversity, while safeguarding human health of family farmers and contributing to the overall
objective of sustainable agriculture.

2. CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONVERSION
TO ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
The conversion from a conventional to an organic system requires a transitory period, where the
organic practices are applied progressively following an organized plan. During this period it is
important to analyse carefully the actual situation of the farm and identify the actions to be taken
(Florez, 2003).
The analysis of the farm must include (Figure 2-1):
1. Farm characteristics: size, plots and crops distribution, which kind of crops, trees, animals are
integrated in the farm system.
2. Soil Analysis: an evaluation of the soil structure, nutrient levels, organic matter content,
erosion level, and/or the soil have been contaminated.
3. Climate: rainfall distribution and quantity, temperatures, frost risks, humidity.
4. Organic matter sources and management (manures).
5. Presence of animal housing systems and/or machinery.
6. Limiting factors such as capital, labour, market access, among others.
This information will help you to have a clear picture of your farm and to take decisions.
Conversion to organic agriculture describes the process of learning and implementation of changes on
the farm towards a more sustainable and natural way of farming. The form the process takes depends
on the local circumstances and the predisposition of the farmer or the community, and it varies from
farm to farm. The more knowledge a farmer has about the concepts and practices of organic farming,
the easier conversion process to organic farming will be. Even if organic farming does not depend on
specific land conditions to start with, if soils are depleted for example, it may need greater efforts and
require more patience to establish a sustainable production system and realize satisfying harvests.
Here, you will find the factors to be considered during conversion to organic agriculture and some
recommendations to succeed during the process.
SUMMARY
FIGURE 2-1 - PREPARING FOR THE CONVERSION
12
Depending on the farm situation, different challenges are to be expected during conversion:
1. FARMS WITH HIGH EXTERNAL INPUT USE
The majority of intensively managed farms in Africa, Latin America and Asia that strongly rely on
external inputs are larger farms. Such farms mostly grow a few annual or perennial cash crops relying
heavily on the use of fertilizers for plant nutrition and pesticides and herbicides for pest, disease and
weed control. On such farms crops are often grown without a planned rotation and farm animals are
not integrated into the nutrient cycle. Diversification is usually low on these farms. Trees and bushes
are mostly removed to facilitate extensive mechanization, and crops are mostly grown alone. (Figure
2-2).
Potential challenges in conversion of such farms (Figure 2-3):
 Establishing a diverse and balanced farming system with a natural ability to regulate itself
usually takes several years.
 Major efforts may be necessary to restore natural soil fertility by providing a considerable
amount of organic matter to the soil.
 Abandoning high input external fertilizers results in yield depression in the first years of
conversion, before soil fertility is re-established and yields rise again.
 New approaches and practices usually involve a lot of learning and intensive observation of
crop development, and dynamics of pests, diseases and natural enemies.
FIGURE 2-2 - CONVERSION OF A HIGH EXTERNAL INPUT FARM
13
FIGURE 2-3 - MINIMIZING EXTERNAL INPUT
However, the conversion process can be achieved, if the following practices are implemented:
 Diversify the farming system: Select appropriate annual crops for the area and rotate them
in a planned sequence. Include legume crops such as beans or leguminous feed crops in the
rotation to provide nitrogen to the subsequent crops. Plant hedges and flower strips to
encourage natural enemies and to control pests.
 Start recycling valuable farm by-products. Establish on-farm compost production based on
harvest residues and manure, if available, and mix the compost with the topsoil. This will bring
stable organic matter into the soil and improve its structure and its capacity to feed the plants
and store water. Green manures can provide plenty of plant material to feed soil organisms
and build up soil fertility (Figure 2-4).
 Introduce farm animals into the system. Farm animals provide valuable manure and
diversify farm income through additional animal products.
 Grow cover crops. Cover crops or lay out mulches in perennial crops provide protection to the
soil.
FIGURE 2-4 - RECYCLING VALUABLE FARM BY-PRODUCTS

2. FARM WITH LOW EXTERNAL INPUT USE
Farmers working with little external inputs based on traditional practices may grow many different
crops in a densely mixed system on the same piece of land changing crops randomly. A few livestock
such as chickens, pigs, cattle and/or goats may be kept, which scatter the manure in their feeding
places, hence providing very little manure for the gardens. The trees may be extensively cut for
firewood and charcoal burning. Bush and trash burning may be a common practise especially during
land preparation. Harvests are probably low and increasingly becoming difficult due to unreliable and
insufficient rains. The harvests may just be sufficient for feeding the family and little may be left to sell
for income. (Figure 2-5).
FIGURE 2-5 - CONVERSION OF A LOW EXTERNAL INPUT FARM
Traditional farmers fulfil some principles of organic farming already by relying on farm-own resources,
growing different crops simultaneously and raising livestock. However, there are still practices, which
clearly distinguish such farms from organic farms. The following challenges need to be addressed for
conversion:
 Avoid burning of crop residues after harvest as this is, in most cases, not a viable solution,
since it destroys valuable organic material and damages soil organisms.
 Establish a well organised diversification systems including a ‘planned’ crop rotation and
intercropping systems.
 Accumulate knowledge and practice regarding efficient use of farm own resources, especially
for compost production to manage and improve soil fertility.
 Avoid indiscriminate tree cutting for firewood and charcoal burning.
 Establish a system to collect the animal manure for composting.
 Apply measures to prevent loss of soil through erosion and protect it from drying out.
 Pay special attention to satisfy feed and health requirements of the farm animals.
 Avoid infection of seeds with diseases, gain knowledge on disease cycles and preventive
measures.
 Avoid harvest and storage losses.
Some practices for conversion in this system are (Figure 2-6):
 Implement planned crop rotation and intercropping systems. A combination of annual and
perennial crops including leguminous green manure cover crops is needed. Combined with 
15
properly selected or improved crop varieties with good resistance to plant pests and diseases,
will facilitate the crop and soil management.
 Proper integration of animals into the farming system, as well as planting rows of nitrogen
fixing trees between annual crops will improve the growing conditions for the crops and
encourage better growth, while providing additional feed for the ruminant animals. Better
housing is also needed to facilitate collection of animal manure for field use.
 Improving the fertility of the soils, for example, through the application of high quality compost.
Compost is a highly valuable fertilizer in organic farming. Instead of burning the crop residues
after harvest, collect them for compost production, or work them into the soil. The animal
manures and plant materials should be regularly collected for compost making.
 Growing nitrogen fixing legumes between annual crops is another possibility to feed the soil
and the crops.
 Additional measures to control soil erosion such as digging trenches and planting trees along
the hillside, and covering the soil with living or dead plant material should be implemented.
FIGURE 2-6 - SOME ORGANIC FARMING METHODS TO TEST IN YOUR OWN FARM
3. MIXED FARM
On mixed farms, crops and farm animals may be integrated, whereby the animal manure is collected
and used in the gardens after having kept it for a few weeks to rot. Some soil conservation measures
may be implemented, such as mulching in perennial crops and trenches to reduce erosion.
Occasionally herbicides, pesticides and treated seeds may be used to control weeds in fruit and
vegetable production. Farmers of such mixed farms are obviously familiar with some of the organic
farming practices. Such farmers will find it easy to learn new methods from other farmers or from a
trainer and to implement organic practices throughout the farm.
16
FIGURE 2-7 - CONVERSION OF A MIXED FARM
Recommendations for organic conversion (Figure 2-7):
 Implement organic practices to manage the soil and to control weeds instead of using
herbicides. For example, in fruit orchards grow a leguminous cover crop to cover the soil. Or in
vegetables and arable crops implement a planned crop rotation that includes weed
suppressing green manure or feed crops.
 Further improve recycling of farm own nutrients from animals and crop residues to make best
uses of them, for example by mixing them with crop residues for making compost. Improve
storage of animal manures to avoid nutrient losses.
 Use seeds without pesticide-treatments, if available. Make sure to use healthy seeds only and
get familiar with non-chemical ways of treating seeds.
 Get familiar with approaches and methods of natural pest and disease control.
 Learn about beneficial insects and observe population dynamics of pests through regular
monitoring during crop growth.
 Further diversify the farming system to increase productivity of the land and provide habitats
for beneficial insects and spiders.
4. DEGRADED LAND
Land may be degraded due to shifting cultivation, overgrazing, over-cultivation or deforestation,
salinity after years of intensive irrigation with ground water, or water logging and flooding. Such land
may take more effort and patience to establish good growing conditions. At the same time, organic
practices are an excellent approach to recover such soils. It may require specific practices to stop soil
degradation and to re-establish soil fertility. Such practices include digging of terraces or sowing an
intensive fallow with a leguminous green manure crop that grows well on poor soils. (Figure 2-8). 
17
FIGURE 2-8 - CONVERSION OF DEGRADED LAND
Many experiences show that organic farming is a promising approach to improve degraded land and
bring it back into production. In most cases, the increase of organic matter plays a key role to improve
the quality of degraded soils.
In case of a bare and eroded soil on sloping land, organic farming calls for digging of terraces (e.g.
fanya juu terraces, see the figure below). Fanya juu (‘throw it upwards’ in Kiswahili) terraces are made
by digging trenches along the contours and throwing the soil uphill to form embankments (bunds),
which are stabilized with fodder grass like Napier (Pennisentum purpureum) and multipurpose
agroforestry trees (Figure 2-9). The space between the embankments is cultivated with crops and over
time, the fanya juu develop into bench terraces. They are useful in semi-arid areas to harvest and
conserve water. Additionally, green manures and compost can be used to further build the soil to
support good crop growth and yields.
Saline soils contain large amounts of water soluble salts that inhibit seed germination and plant
growth. These salts may have been accumulated through excessive use of irrigation water, especially
in arid and semi-arid climates. These salts can be reduced slowly by ensuring proper irrigation and
building up the structure of the soil with compost to allow natural drainage of the excess salts. In a
first period salt tolerant crops may be grown.
Acid soils can be reclaimed by adding lime and well-made compost.
Flooded soils can be improved by creating drainage channels to drain off the excess water.
18
FIGURE 2-9 - FANYA-JUU TERRACES TECHNIQUES OF KENYA
Converting a farm to organic farming in an area with very little rainfall and high temperatures or
strong winds will be more challenging than converting a farm located in an area with well distributed
rainfall and favourable temperatures. At the same time, the improvements that follow implementation
of organic practices will be more obvious under arid conditions than under ideal humid conditions.
For example, compost application into topsoil or into planting holes will increase the soils water
retention capacity and the crop’s tolerance to water scarcity.
In very warm and dry climate, losses of water through transpiration from plants and evaporation
from soils are high. These losses may be further encouraged by strong winds, enhancing soil erosion.
The soils’ organic matter content is generally low, as biomass production is low, implying that the
availability of nutrients to the plants is highly reduced. (Figure 2-10).
Under such conditions, the key to increasing crop productivity lies in protecting the soil from strong
sun and wind and increasing the supply of organic matter and water to the soil. Soil organic matter can
either be increased through compost or through cultivation of green manure crops. In the case of
compost production the challenge is to increase production of plant biomass, which is needed for
compost production.
19
FIGURE 2-10 - CONVERSION IN DRY CLIMATE
In warm and humid climate, high aboveground biomass production and rapid decomposition of soil
organic matter imply that the nutrients are easily made available to the plants. But it also involves a
high risk that the nutrients are easily washed out and lost. Under such conditions a balance between
production and decomposition of organic matter is important to avoid depletion of soil.
Combining different practices to protect the soil and feed it with organic matter proves to be the most
effective approach to choose. These practices include creating a diverse and multi-layer cropping
system ideally including trees, growing nitrogen-fixing cover crops in orchards and applying compost
to enrich the soil with organic matter and in this way increase its capacity to retain water and
nutrients.

3. STEP BY STEP CONVERSION
TO ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
The procedure of conversion of a farm commonly consists of three steps. In a first step, it is
recommended to collect information on appropriate organic farming practices. In a second step, the
most promising organic practices should be tried out on selected plots or fields to get familiar with. In
a third step, only organic procedures should be implemented in the entire farm. Support from an
experienced extension officer or a farmer is usually very helpful to give guidance in the process.
FIGURE 3-1 - HOW TO BECOME AN ORGANIC FARMER?
Successful organic farming requires considerable knowledge on the functioning and the possibilities of
management of natural processes. Interest in learning about the possibilities to support natural
processes to sustain and improve harvests is essential for successful organic farming. Farmers who are
interested in adopting organic farming practices are recommended to get in contact with farmers in
the area (Figure 3-1), who already practice organic farming to learn from them. Some farmers may be
good at making compost, some at growing green manures, and some at making plant or manure tea.
Learning from experienced farmers allows to get first-hand experience under local conditions, and
thus to learn about the advantages and potential challenges related to implementing organic methods.
(Figure 3-2).
SUMMARY
21
FIGURE 3-2 - HOW TO GET INFORMATION ON ORGANIC AGRICULTURE?
Basically, farmers who are interested in converting their farm to organic agriculture need to know:
 How to improve soil fertility.
 How to keep crops healthy.
 How to best increase diversity in the farm.
 How to keep livestock healthy.
 How to give value to organic products and how to successfully sell them.
After having collected information about the requirements, the potentials and the main practices
related to conversion, farmers should start to learn from their own experience on their farms. To
minimize risks of crop failure and losses of animals, and avoid frustrating overload, farmers are
recommended to implement organic practices step-by-step to a limited extent, selecting specific
practices at a time and testing them on selected plots or selected animals only. But which practices
should one choose to start with? As would seem natural, farmers should start by applying practices
that are of low risk and investment, require little specific knowledge, limited additional labour, and
with high short term impact. Examples of recommended interventions include (Figure 3-3):
 Mulching - Covering the soil with dead plant material is an easy way to control weeds and
protect the soil in annual crops. This practice can be implemented into most existing cropping systems.
The main question may be, however, where to get appropriate plant material from.
 Intercropping - Growing two annual crops together, commonly a leguminous crop like beans
or a green manure crop in alternating rows with maize or another cereal crop or vegetable is a
common practice in organic farming to diversify production and maximize benefits from the land. In
intercropping, special attention must be paid to avoid competition between the crops for light,
nutrients and water. This requires knowledge on arrangements, which promote growth of at least one
of the crops.
 Composting - Application of compost to the fields can have a major impact on crop growth and
yields. To start compost production, farmers will need enough plant materials and animal manures, if
such are available. In case such materials are scarce, farmers would first have to start producing plant 
22
materials on the farm by sowing fast growing leguminous plants that build a lot of biomass, and by
introducing some livestock on the farm for manure production, if this proves appropriate. To get
familiar with the process of making compost, farmers should be instructed by an experienced person.
Proper compost production requires some knowledge and experience and additional labor, but is low
in investments.
 Green manuring - The practice of growing a leguminous plant species for biomass production
and incorporation into the soil may be new to most farmers. Nevertheless, this practice can greatly
contribute to improvement of soil fertility. Green manures can be grown as improved fallows, as
seasonal green manures in rotation with other crops, or in strips between crops. Proper green
manuring first requires information on appropriate species.
 Organic pest management – Careful associations and management of plants and animals in
order to prevent pest and disease outbreaks. Initially, bio-control agents may be applied but organic
pest management is best achieved through ecological approaches that establish a pest/predator
balance. While the choice of resistant varieties of crops is paramount, other prevention methods
include: choosing sowing times that prevent pest outbreaks; improving soil health to resist soil
pathogens; rotating crops; encouraging natural biological agents for control of disease, insects and
weeds; using physical barriers for protection from insects, birds and animals; modifying habitat to
encourage pollinators and natural enemies; and trapping pests in pheromone attractants.
 Appropriate seeds and planting material - Use of healthy seeds and planting materials, and
robust and/or improved cultivars can make a big change in crop production. This practice may require
some information on selection of seeds and planting materials including availability of improved
varieties and seed treatments. Generally, locally-adapted seeds are preferred because of their
resilience to local conditions.
 Planting of leguminous trees - In perennial crop plantations such as banana, coffee or cocoa,
planting of leguminous trees such as gliricidia, calliandra, and sesbania may improve the growing
conditions of the fruit crop by providing shade, mulching material and nitrogen through nitrogen
fixation. In addition, some leguminous trees provide good fodder for livestock. This practice requires
some knowledge on shade and space requirements of the tree crops and thus on ideal planting
patterns for the leguminous trees.
 Growing farm-own animal feeds - To improve available feeds for the livestock, farmers may
grow grasses and leguminous fodder crops around, between other crops or in rotation. As animal feed
must be of organic origin, feed sources are best addressed by considering farm grown feed.
 Terraces and soil bunds - Construction of terraces and soil bunds along the curves of hills is a
key measure for soil conservation. This practice builds the foundation of further improvement to soil
fertility on slopes. It is of high relevance, but requires much labor and some specific knowledge for
appropriate implementation.
23
FIGURE 3-3 - HOW TO START IMPLEMENTING ORGANIC PRACTICES?
Looking at the organic farm as being ‘one organism’, the focus does not lie on cultivating specific crops
only. Rather, the focus is on choosing crops that can easily be integrated into the existing farming
system and will contribute to its improvement. But the choice also depends on the farmer’s knowledge
on the right management of the crops, their contribution to a diverse family diet or their demand in
the market. Besides growing crops for food, farmers may need to grow leguminous cover crops to
provide high-protein feed for livestock and to be used as green manures to feed the soil. Planting trees
for shade, as windbreak, for firewood, feed, mulching material or for other uses, can be recommended
in most situations.
Criteria for crop selection during conversion (Figure 3-4):
a. In the first place, organic farmers should grow enough food for the family. But they may also
want to grow crops for the market to get money for other family needs. The farmers should
also grow crops that contribute to improvement of soil fertility. Farmers who keep livestock
need to grow pasture grass and legumes.
b. Basically, farmers should select crops with low risk of failure. Cereals and legumes such as
maize, sorghum, millet, beans and peas are especially suitable for conversion, since they
cost little to produce, generally have moderate nutrient demands and are robust against pests
and diseases. In addition, many of the traditional crops can be stored and sold in domestic
markets. High-value short term crops, such as most vegetables, are more delicate to grow
and highly susceptible to pest and disease attack. Therefore, they should not be grown on a
larger scale, unless the farmer can sustain some losses in harvest.
c. The crops to grow for sale should include crops that can be sold at the farm gate, at the
roadside market or can be transported directly to nearby markets in urban centres. Choosing
the right crop to sell on the market may require some market information. Decision making for
crops for local or export markets requires detailed information from traders or exporters on
the crops, requested varieties, quantities, qualities, regularity and season.
d. High-value perennial crops such as fruit trees take at least 3 years until the first harvest
from the date of planting. This makes them appropriate crops for the conversion period. For 
24
new plantations, species and varieties must be carefully selected to suit the organic market and
production requirements. For conversion of an existing orchard, it might be necessary to
replace old existing varieties, if they are very susceptible to diseases and the product quality
does not match with the market requirements.
e. The success of a crop will also depend on provision of favourable growing conditions. The
better a crop variety matches local soil and climate conditions, and is tolerant or resistant to
common pests and diseases, the better it will grow.
f. Planting of hedges other crops and/or agroforestry trees can be valuable to help establish a
diverse farming system.
g. Growing leguminous green manures provides nutrients to the soil. Green manures do not
provide immediate income, but in the long-term, they make the soil fertile and productive for
the future.
FIGURE 3-4 - WHICH CROPS SHOULD I GROW?
Many farmers want to see quick results and often ask how long it takes for organic crops to grow.
Organic farming does not aim to make crops grow faster. Crops will grow faster and larger when they
have better growing conditions than before. Although conventionally grown crops can be made to
grow faster by intensive use of synthetic fertilizers and sprays. Organic crops are nurtured to grow at
their normal, natural rate in order to be less susceptible to pests and diseases and build up good
physical and nutritional structure. However, organic farmers do a lot to make their crops grow healthy
and to produce good yields.
In a third step, implementation of organic practices throughout the entire farm should be considered,
once sufficient experience with different practices has been gained. As soon as organic practices are
implemented throughout the entire farm, a farmer can claim to be an organic farmer.
25
Commonly, consistent application of organic practices marks the beginning of a long process of
improving the production system:
1. Improving soil fertility based on the recycling of farm own organic materials and
enhancement of farm own biomass production.
2. Encouraging positive interactions between all parts of the production system (the farm
ecosystem) to enhance self-regulation of pests and diseases.
3. Optimizing the balance between feed production and livestock.
Farming organically also means continuously learning from personal observation, from outside
experiences, sharing experiences with other organic farmers and implementing new information on
the your farm, making it increasingly more sustainable.
a) Pesticides:
Organic farmers are responsible to protect the organic fields from being sprayed with synthetic
pesticides (Figure 3-5). Even if the neighbour is not farming organically, an organic farmer can grow
organic foods and fibres. To avoid pesticide drift from neighbouring fields onto the crops, organic
farmers should safeguard the organic fields by using any of the following measures:
 Planting of natural hedges on the boundary to neighbouring fields can avoid the risk of
pesticide spray drift through wind or run-off water. The wider the border area around the
fields, the better.
 To avoid runoff from upstream fields, organic farmers should divert the water away or talk to
the farmers upstream about how to work together to minimize the risk of contamination
through water. Organic farmers, who are interested in saving nature, should share their
knowledge and experiences with neighbours with the aim of helping them to either adopt
organic farming practices or to minimize the risk of contaminating nature.
FIGURE 3-5 - HOW TO PROTECT CROPS FROM PESTICIDE DRIFT?
26
b) Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO):
Genetically modified seeds and planting materials are produced by transferring isolated genes from
plants, animals or microorganisms into the crop genome, by using methods different from pollination
and crossing natural barriers. Genetically modified products should, therefore, not be used in
organic farming, and organic farmers should protect their production against any GMO
contamination (Figure 3-6).
However, with the increased use of GM crops in the conventional farming systems, the risk of GMO
contamination is expected to increase. Species which cross-pollinate, such as rapeseed or maize, or
insect pollinated crops, such as soybean or cotton, are at a higher risk of being contaminated by a
nearby genetically modified crop. Species that are mainly vegetative pollinated such as potatoes,
cassava or banana are at lower risk of GMO contamination. Besides the genetic contamination, there is
also a risk of physical contamination caused by GMO residues along the production and market chain,
if GMO and organic products are not properly separated during storage and transportation.
FIGURE 3-6 - HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK OF GMO CONTAMINATION?
Recommendations to farmers for reducing the GMO contamination risk:
 Use either personally selected seeds or get organic or untreated seeds. Verify the origin of the
seeds, making sure that they do not come from neighbouring farmers where GM crops are
grown, or from farms surrounded by GM crops (minimum distance of at least 1 km).
 If you use seeds from a trader, make sure that they are registered and can confirm where the
seed is derived from. Check that he is not involved in GM production and multiplication. Ask
your trader for a certificate confirming GM free seeds and inquire about the trader’s
involvement in the GM-seed market.
 Check for the breeding habits of the specific crops you are interested in. Most cross breeding
species such as maize can disperse by wind or bees to distances of up to 1 to 3 km.
 Seeds of some crops can survive for 5 to 20 years in the soil. Therefore, precautions must be
taken that no GM crops have been planted on land that shall be used for organic production.
 Create protective safety (buffer) zones around your fields to reduce the risk of GMO pollen
dispersal, if GM crops are cultivated in this region. Isolation distances between GM crops and 
27
organic fields should be established, about 2-3 times larger than those required for seed
production for a given species. For dispersal of critical GM crops such as maize, the isolation
distance should probably not be less than 2 to 3 km. This will reduce GMO dispersal by pollen
to a great extent. For wind pollinated crops, like maize, borders or hedges with taller plant
species, such as sugarcane or trees, can additionally prevent cross-pollination with GM crops.
 Avoid any physical GM contamination by using sowing and harvesting machines, transporters,
processing and storage facilities not used by GM farmers. In case you have to use the same
machines, thorough cleaning is necessary. Do not store organic products next to GM products.
 GMO free regions should be encouraged wherever possible, especially for own seed production.

4. MULCHING IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Mulching is the process of covering the topsoil with plant material such as leaves, grass, twigs, crop
residues, straw etc. A mulch cover enhances the activity of soil organisms such as earthworms. They
help to create a soil structure with plenty of smaller and larger pores through which rainwater can
easily infiltrate into the soil, thus reducing surface runoff. As the mulch material decomposes, it
increases the content of organic matter in the soil. Soil organic matter helps to create a good soil with
stable crumb structure. Thus the soil particles will not be easily carried away by water. Therefore,
mulching plays a crucial role in preventing soil erosion.
In some places, materials such as plastic sheets or even stones are used for covering the soil. However,
in organic agriculture the term ‘mulching’ refers only to the use of organic, degradable plant materials.
(FIGURE 4-1)
 Protecting the soil from wind and water erosion: soil particles cannot be washed or blown
away.
 Improving the infiltration of rain and irrigation water by maintaining a good soil structure: no
crust is formed, the pores are kept open
 Keeping the soil moist by reducing evaporation: plants need less irrigation or can use the
available rain more efficiently in dry areas or seasons
 Feeding and protecting soil organisms: organic mulch material is an excellent food for soil
organisms and provides suitable conditions for their growth
 Suppressing weed growth: with a sufficient mulch layer, weeds will find it difficult to grow
through it
 Preventing the soil from heating up too much: mulch provides shade to the soil and the
retained moisture keeps it cool
 Providing nutrients to the crops: while decomposing, organic mulch material continuously
releases its nutrients, thus fertilizing the soil
 Increasing the content of soil organic matter: part of the mulch material will be trans-formed to
humus
SUMMARY
29
FIGURE 4-1 - SKETCH ON THE EFFECTS OF MULCHING
The kind of material used for mulching will greatly influence its effect. Material which easily
decomposes will protect the soil only for a rather short time but will provide nutrients to the crops
while decomposing. Hardy materials will decompose more slowly and therefore cover the soil for a
longer time. If the decomposition of the mulch material should be accelerated, organic manures such
as animal dung may be spread on top of the mulch, thus increasing the nitrogen content (Figure 4-2).
FIGURE 4-2 -OPTIMISING NITROGEN CYCLING IN THE FARM.
SCHEME OF A FARM WITH FIELDS AND ANIMALS SHOWING INPUTS, OUTPUTS AND LOSSES
Where soil erosion is a problem, slowly decomposing mulch material (low nitrogen content, high
C/N) will provide a long-term protection compared to quickly decomposing material.
30
 Weeds or cover crops
 Crop residues
 Grass
 Pruning material from trees
 Cuttings from hedges
 Wastes from agricultural processing or from forestry
While mulching has a lot of advantages, it can also cause problems in specific situations:
 Some organisms can proliferate too much in the moist and protected conditions of the mulch
layer. Slugs and snails can multiply very quickly under a mulch layer. Ants or termites which
may cause damage to the crops also may find ideal conditions for living.
 When crop residues are used for mulching, in some cases there is an increased risk of
sustaining pests and diseases. Damaging organisms such as stem borers may survive in the
stalks of crops like cotton, corn or sugar cane. Plant material infected with viral or fungal
diseases should not be used if there is a risk that the disease might spread to the next crop.
Crop rotation is very important to overcome these risks.
 When carbon rich materials such as straw or stalks are used for mulching, nitrogen from the
soil may be used by microorganisms for decomposing the material. Thus, nitrogen may be
temporary not available for plant growth.
 The major constraint for mulching usually is the availability of organic material. Its production
or collection usually involves labour and may compete with the production of crops.
FIGURE 4-3 - POTENTIAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO MULCHING (PHOTO OF A MULCH LAYER)
If possible, the mulch should be applied before or at the onset of the rainy season, as then the soil is
most vulnerable. 
31
If the layer of mulch is not too thick, seeds or seedlings can be directly sown or planted in between the
mulching material. On vegetable plots it is best to apply mulch only after the young plants have
become somewhat hardier, as they may be harmed by the products of decomposition from fresh mulch
material.
FIGURE 4-4 - MULCH APPLIED IN VEGETABLE FIELDS IN THE PHILIPPINES,
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF MULCH IN KEY WORDS
If mulch is applied prior to sowing or planting, the mulch layer should not be too thick in order to
allow seedlings to penetrate it. Mulch can also be applied in established crops, best directly after
digging the soil. It can be applied between the rows, directly around single plants (especially for tree
crops) or evenly spread on the field.
The Japanese organic pioneer Fukuoka developed a system of growing rice which is based on mulching.
White clover is sown among the rice one month before harvesting. Shortly thereafter, a winter crop of
rye is sown. After threshing the harvested rice, the rice straw is brought back to the field where it is
used as a loose mulch layer. Both the rye and the white clover spring up through the mulch which
remains until the rye is harvested. If the straw decomposes too slowly, chicken manure is sprinkled
over the mulch. This cropping system does not require any tillage of the soil, but achieves satisfying
yields.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIC
AGRICULTURE
Scarcity of water for agriculture is a common phenomenon in many countries. In some regions it is
almost impossible to grow crops without irrigation. Even in areas with large amounts of rainfall in the
rainy season, crops may get short of water during dry periods.
Organic farming aims at optimising the use of on-farm resources and at a sustainable use of natural
resources. Active water retention, water harvesting and storing of water are important practices,
especially for organic farmers. Organic farmers know that it is more important to first improve the
water retention and the infiltration of water into the soil.
A. (FIGURE 5-1)
 Keep soil moisture: During dry periods, some soils are more and some are less in a position to
supply crops with water. The ability of a soil to absorb and store water largely depends on the soil
composition and on the content of organic matter. Soils rich in clay can store up to three times
more water than sandy soils. Soil organic matter acts as storage of water, just like a sponge.
Therefore, crop residue or a cover crop protects the soil, prevents crusting on the surface, and
slows runoff. Roots, earthworms and other soil life maintain cracks and pores in the soil. Less
water runs off, and more sinks into the soil.
 Reduce evaporation: A thin layer of mulch can considerably reduce the evaporation of water
from the soil. It shades the soil from direct sunlight and prevents the soil from getting too warm.
Shallow digging of the dry top soil can help to reduce the drying up of the soil layers beneath (it
breaks the capillary vessels). A better retention of water within the soil saves costs on irrigation.
 Better use of season’s rainfall: Ripping during the dry season allows farmers to plant earlier –
right at the start of the rains.
SUMMARY
33
FIGURE 5-1 - APPROACHES FOR WATER CONSERVATION
ATTENTION: A green manure or cover crop is not always a suitable way of reducing evaporation from
the soil, due that they also use water. In dry areas, you should consider using other types of mulch,
such as crop residues or plant remains brought in from outside the field. That will help conserve
moisture in the soil where it can be used by the crop.
1. INCREASING INFILTRATION
During strong rains, only a part of the water infiltrates into the soil. A considerable part flows away as
surface runoff, thus being lost for the crop. In order to get as much of the available rainwater into the
soil, the infiltration of rainwater needs to be increased (Figure 5-2). 
34
FIGURE 5-2 -INCREASING THE INFILTRATION
The most important for achieving a high infiltration is to maintain a topsoil with a good soil structure
containing many cavities and pores (e.g. from earthworms). Cover crops and mulch application are
suitable to create such a favourable top soil structure. Further, they help to slow down the flow of
water, thus allowing more time for the infiltration.
Some techniques to harvest water include:
Planting pits (known as zai in Burkina Faso and tassa in Niger, Figure 5-3) are hand-dug circular holes
which collect water and store it for use by the crop. Each pit is about 20 cm across and 20 cm deep.
After planting, the holes are left partly open so they collect water. Planting pits take a lot of work to dig
when the soil is dry. But they produce good yields in areas where otherwise crops might die because of
a lack of water. Once made, the pits can be used again, season after season. Leave the soil covered, and
add compost or fertilizer to the pits to increase their fertility.

In areas with low rainfall, there may not be enough water to grow a crop over the whole area. On
gentle slopes (less than 3%), one possibility is to use contour bunds and catchment strips. Catchment
strips are areas where no crops are planted. When rain falls on this ground, it runs downslope and is
trapped by the contour bund. Plant rows of crops behind the bund to use this water. This can produce
a good yield even with very little rain. Mulch the cultivated areas with crop residues to prevent erosion,
help water sink in, and slow evaporation.
The picture below (Figure 5-4) shows an example of a farmer in Botswana, who makes his cropped
strips 0,8–1 m wide a 3,3 m apart. He subsoils these strips using a tractor-powered subsoiler to a
depth of 0,7 m. He shapes the land between the strips so it slopes towards the cropped strips, so
rainwater will flow towards the crop. He plants two rows of maize in each strip, and sows a cover crop
such as cowpea in between the strips. The strips are permanent: they can be used to grow crops
season after season. The soil in the strips gradually improves in fertility as crop residues accumulate
there. Rotating maize with a legume crop will improve the soil fertility further. The farmer has been
able to grow up to 6 t/ha of maize with less than 400 mm/season of rain.

Water from roads – and from other unproductive areas such as paths and homestead compounds – can
be channelled onto fields. It may be possible to divert water from structures that already exist, such as
the ditches below fanya juu terraces. Or special bunds can be built around fields close to the road.
Another possibility is to direct the water into a pond, which can be used to irrigate crops. (Figure 5-5 &
5-6).

Half-moon microcatchments are small, semicircular earth bunds. They are quite common on the desert
margins of the Sahel, where they are called “demilunes”. The half-moons catch water flowing down a
slope. Crops such as sorghum, millet and cowpeas can be planted in the lower portion of the halfmoons.
Half-moons are helpful to rehabilitate degraded land. (Figure 5-7).

2. WATER STORAGE
Excess water in the rainy season may be made use of during dry periods. There are many possibilities
of storing rainwater for irrigation, but most of them are labouring intensive or costly. Storing water in
ponds has the advantage that fish may be grown, but water is likely to be lost through infiltration and
evaporation. The construction of water tanks may avoid these losses, but needs appropriate
construction materials. To decide whether or not to build water storage infrastructure, the benefits
should be weighed against the costs, including the loss of arable land.
The major factors that determine the necessity of irrigation are the selection of crops and an
appropriate cropping system. Obviously, not all crops (and not even all varieties of the same crop)
require the same amount of water, and not all need water over the same period of time.
Some crops are very resistant to drought while others are highly susceptible. Deep rooting crops can
extract water from deeper layers of soil and hence they are less sensitive to temporary droughts.
With the help of irrigation, many crops can nowadays be grown outside their typical agro-climatic
region. This may cause not only the above mentioned negative impacts, but also some advantages. It
may make it possible to cultivate land which would otherwise be unsuitable for agriculture without
irrigation. Or the cultivation of sensitive crops can be shifted into areas with less pest or disease
pressure.
There are irrigation systems of higher or lower efficiency and with more or less negative impact. If
irrigation is necessary, organic farmers should carefully select a system, which is does not overexploit
the water source, does not harm the soil and has no negative impact on plant health.
38
One promising option are drip irrigation systems (Figure 5-8). From a central tank, water is
distributed through thin perforated pipes directly to the single crop plants. There is a continuous but
very light flow of water, thus allowing sufficient time to infiltrate in the root zone of the crops. In this
way, a minimum of water is lost and the soil is not negatively affected.
FIGURE 5-8 - DRIP IRRIGATION
The establishment of drip irrigation systems can be quite costly. However, some farmers have
developed low cost drip irrigation systems from locally available materials. Whatever irrigation
system the farmer chooses, he will reach higher efficiency if it is combined with accompanying
measures for improving the soil structure and the water retention of the soil, as described above.

6. CROP PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
In many traditional agricultural systems a diversity of crops in time or space can be found. Knowing
that different plants have different requirements for nutrients, a good crop planning and management
is required in order to optimise the use of nutrient in the soil. Crop rotation, intercropping, cover crops
and green manures represent the main alternatives to the farmers to manage soil health and fertility.
The first three practices will be described in this section.
Crop rotation means changing the type of crops grown in the field each season or each year (IIRR and
ACT 2005). It is a critical feature of all organic cropping system, because it provides the principal
mechanisms for building healthy soils, a major way to control pests, weeds, and to maintain soil
organic matter (Mohler and Johnson 2009). In more details, crop rotation brings the following benefits
(IIRR and ACT 2005):
 It improves soil structure: some crops have strong, deep roots. They can break up hardpans,
and tap moisture and nutrients from deep in the soil. Others have many fine, shallow roots.
They tap nutrients near the surface and bind the soil. They form many tiny holes so that air and
water can get into the soil. (Figure 6-1).
FIGURE 6-1 - BETTER USE OF ROOT SPACE IN ASSOCIATED CROPS
 It increases soil fertility: legumes (such as groundnuts and beans) fix nitrogen in the soil.
When their green parts and roots rot, this nitrogen can be used by other crops such as maize.
The result is higher, more stable yields, without the need to apply expensive inorganic
fertilizer.
 It helps control weeds, pests and diseases: planting the same crop season after season
encourages certain weeds, insects and diseases. Planting different crops breaks their life cycle
and prevents them from multiplying.
 It produces different types of output: growing a mix of grain, beans, vegetables and fodder
means a more varied diet and more types of produce to sell.
SUMMARY
40
 In some ways, crop rotation takes the place of ploughing the soil: it helps aerate the soil,
recycles nutrients, and helps control weeds, pests and diseases. Intercropping, strip cropping
and relay cropping bring many of the same advantages as rotation.
a) Crop selection
Before selecting the crops, it is necessary to answer the following question:
 What to produce? Crops produce many different things: food, fodder, firewood, fence poles, thatch
and medicines. Farmers grow some crops (such as cotton) only for cash. For other crops, such as
cereals or vegetables, you may be able to sell what you do not use yourself. If your objective is
marketing, make sure that there is a market of your main output or rotation crop.
 Will it grow well? This depends on many factors: the amount of rain or moisture in the soil, the
season (some crops and varieties do not grow well at certain times of year), the soil fertility, among
others.
 What are the roots like? Tall cereals (millet, maize, sorghum, etc.), finger millets and some
legumes (e.g., pigeonpea and sunn hemp) have strong roots that penetrate deep into the soil – up to
1,2 m for tall cereals. Their roots improve the soil structure and porosity, so are a good choice if the
soil is compacted. (Figure 6-2).
FIGURE 6-2 - DIFFERENT CROPS HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROOTS
 Does it improve the soil fertility? Legumes improve the soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the
air. They use part of it for their own needs, and leave the rest in the soil. Cereals and other plants
can use this nitrogen if they are intercropped with the legume, or if they are grown as the next crop
in the rotation.
 Does it cover the soil well? Tall cereals do not cover the soil well because they have upright leaves
and they are planted far apart. Short grasses (Brachiaria, Cenchrus, Andropogon) and many
legumes (lablab, groundnut, cowpea, beans) cover the ground very quickly after they are planted.
When their main use is indeed to provide cover, we call them cover crops. If their main use is to
provide food, we call them food legumes (beans, groundnuts).
 Does it work with other crops? Try to find combinations of crops that complement each other
well (Table 6-1). For example, cereals grow well with legumes (either food legumes or cover crops):
the cereals benefit from the nitrogen fixed by the legume. Two different legumes or two different
cereals do not usually work well together. If you have problems with Striga in your field, you may
want to grow trap crops such as Crotalaria or Tephrosia to encourage the Striga to germinate and 
41
die when they do not find any suitable plants (such as maize or sorghum) they can live off. It may be
more difficult to find the right combination of crops for your situation. You and your neighbours
can try out new combinations to see which ones work. Or you can check with extension workers,
researchers or farmers in other villages to see what they suggest.

b) Choosing the right varieties
Farmers all know that not all sorghum is the same. Some varieties grow quickly and produce a yield in
a short time. Others take longer until harvest. Some are taller than others, or produce more leaves.
Some demand more or less nutrients, some are more tolerant to drought or Striga. The same is true for
other crops. For example, some varieties of cowpeas can be harvested in 55 days; others take more
than 100 days. Some climb, while others crawl on the ground. Choose a variety that has the
characteristics you want. Make sure you get the right seed. If you find a variety that you like, consider
producing your own seed to sow in the future.
c) Choosing a crop rotation
What crops should you plant next year, and the year after that? That depends on many factors, here
are some considerations:
 Knowing the family where your crops belong to helps you to decide what to plant on the next
cropping season, by planting a crop that belongs to a different family to the previous one. The
table below provides various crop families and their common names (Table 6-2):

 Make a list of the crops you want to grow, considering the following recommendations (Mohler
and Johnson 2009):
- Grow winter cover crops BEFORE late-planted crops to accumulate organic matter and nitrogen.
- Grow winter-killed cover crops (oat-pea) BEFORE early season crops, so the seedbed will be easy
to prepare.
- NEVER grow any crop after itself.
- Certain insect pests and diseases may spread easily from one crop to the next through the crop
residues. Avoid crop combinations where this is a problem.
- Markets do not always exist for new crops; however you may want to plant some of them as part of
your rotation. However. If your objective is marketing, ensure that there is a market for your main
output and rotation crops.
- In addition it is important to check the source of seeds and price of the output before you decide
which crops to plant.
- Grow tomatoes AFTER peas, lettuce, or spinach, because tomatoes need a considerable amount of
nutrients.
- Grow lettuce BEFORE potatoes, because it is a light feeder and an aboveground crop.
- Grow legume cover crops BEFORE potatoes or corn, so that they can feed the crops.
- Grow potatoes BEFORE crops that are poor competitors, because potato production involves
aggressive cultivation and further working of the soil during harvest, both of which reduce weed
pressure.
- AVOID growing potatoes before corn, because both are heavy feeders.
- BE CAUTIOUS when growing bell pepper before another vegetable crop, because of diseases.
- AVOID planting potatoes after corn, because of wireworm problems.
 Grow beans AFTER corn to rebuild nitrogen.
 AVOID growing legumes before small grains to prevent lodging.
 Use a summer fallow AFTER onions, because usually there are many weeds.
43
 Grow peas BEFORE fall greens, because there is time for double cropping, and fall greens
benefit from the nitrogen fixed by the peas.
 Grow a root crop like beets AFTER lettuce or cabbage
Intercropping refers to the practice of growing two or more crops in close proximity: growing two or
more cash crops together, growing a cash crop with a cover crop, or other non-cash crop that provide
benefits to the primary crop (Mohler and Johnson 2009).
However, this practice requires additional management to keep competition between intercropped
species in balance. When two or more crops are growing together, each must have adequate space to
maximize cooperation and minimize competition between them. To accomplish this, four things need
to be considered:
1) Spatial arrangement,
2) Plant density,
3) Maturity dates of the crops being grown,
4) Plant architecture.
There are at least four basic spatial arrangements used in intercropping. Most practical systems are
variations of these:
 Row intercropping—growing two or more crops at the same time with at least one crop
planted in rows. This can be beneficial in situations when using tall crops to reduce drought or
heat stress of shorter crops, by providing shade and reducing wind speed. (Figure 6-3).
FIGURE 6-3 - ROW INTERCROPPING WITH ALTERNATE ROWS OF MAIZE AND BEANS (LEFT)
ROW INTERCROPPING WITH ALTERNATE ROWS OF A CEREAL AND A GRASS COVER CROP (RIGHT)
 Strip intercropping—growing two or more crops together in strips wide enough to permit
separate crop production using machines but close enough for the crops to interact, for
example, intercropping beans and maize. Legumes have a nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated
with their roots. Consequently they compete slightly with non-legumes for nutrients, and in
some cases even supply nitrogen to adjacent plants. (Figure 6-4).
44
FIGURE 6-4 - STRIP INTERCROPPING
 Relay intercropping—planting a second crop into a standing crop at a time when the
standing crop is at its reproductive stage but before harvesting (e.g transplanting lettuce next
to tomatoes plants). The lettuce will use the space that is not yet occupied by the tomatoes and
is harvested about the time the tomatoes are branching out to cover the width of the bed.
 Mixed intercropping—growing two or more crops together in no distinct row arrangement
(for further details of possible combination, please see Table 6-1). Some crops may also be
sown as a border crop or as a trap crops at the hedges of the main crop to reduce pests. The
pest, arriving in the field from the edges, encounter the trap crop (which is strongly preferred
than the main crop) and stops. The trap crop may be sprayed with natural insecticide to
control the pest, before it moves to the main crop. (Figure 6-5).
FIGURE 6-5 - MIXED INTERCROPPING (NO ROWS)
A crop mixture with different growth forms or development may make cultivation and use of
mulches more difficult and less effective. Therefore planting crop in alternate rows greatly simplifies
management.
Intercropping may also represent a problem for crop rotation. Knowing that one fundamental
principle of crop rotation is the separation of plant families in time, replanting two families mixed in
the same field may be difficult. However, a good planning could maintain a viable crop rotation. For
example, suppose that a farm grows an area with tomato, squash, broccoli and lettuce. A simple
rotation would put each of the crops in a different year, with a three year interval before a crop is
repeated on the same bed in order to keep some diseases and pest under control.
45
Every plant which covers the soil and improves soil fertility can be a cover crop. It could be a
leguminous plant with other beneficial effects, or it could be a weed characterised by its rapid growth
and enormous production of biomass. The most important property of cover crops is their fast growth
and the capacity of maintaining the soil permanently covered.
The following characteristics make an ideal cover crop (Figure 6-6):
 The seeds are cheap, easy to get, to harvest, to store and to propagate
 Be of rapid rate of growth and be able to cover the soil in short time
 Be resistant against pests and diseases
 Produce large amounts of organic matter and dry material
 Fix nitrogen from the air and provide it to the soil
 Have a de-compacting root system and regenerate degraded soils
 Easy to sow and to manage as single crop or associated with other crops
 Can be used as fodder, grains as food grains
FIGURE 6-6 - CRITERIA FOR AN ''IDEAL'' CROP ROTATION
Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, French: Niébé) is an important grain legume throughout the tropics and
subtropics. It has some properties which make it an ideal cover crop:
 It is drought tolerant and can grow with very little water
 It can fix nitrogen and grows even in very poor soils
 It is shade-tolerant and therefore compatible as an intercrop
 It yields eatable grains and can be used as an animal fodder rich in protein
 It is quite resistant to pest attack
Subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa usually intercrop cowpea in maize, sorghum, millet and
cassava.
Other legumes used as cover crops are alfalfa (Medicago sativa), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum),
Faba beans (Vicia faba) and hairy vetch (Vicia vellosa). 
46
Some cover crops are used to improve the soil structure and to add organic matter to the soil;
examples of non-legumes crops used for this purpose include barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat
(Fagopyron esculentum), oats (Avena sativa), annual rye (Lolium multiflorum), winter wheat (Triticum
aestivum).
This practice integrates crop and livestock systems. In this case, cropping provides animals with
fodder from grass and nitrogen-binding legumes, leys (improved fallow with sown legumes, grasses or
trees), weeds and crop residues. Animals graze under trees or on stubble, they provide draught and
manure for crops, while they also serve as a savings account (FAO, 2001).
An experimental farm in Thailand maintains pigs and chickens, as well as a vegetable garden and a fish
pond. Animal wastes are used for fertilizer, fish feed and biogas generation. Crop and human wastes
are also added to the biogas unit. Liquid effluent from the biogas generator is used in the fishpond and
solid residues on the garden. Periodically, the locations of the garden and the pond are reversed, so
residues from one serve as nutrients for the other (Based on BOSTID, 1981; FAO 2001).
Cropping systems should be designed in such a way that the soil is almost permanently covered with
plant canopy. In arable crops, careful timing of sowing and planting can help to avoid uncovered soil
being washed away during the rainy season.
After the main crops are harvested, a green manure crop may be sown (Figure 6-7). On slopes, crops
should be grown in lines across the slopes (along contour lines) rather than vertically. This can
contribute enormously to reduce the speed of surface water, thus erosion. In crops which take some
time to develop a protecting canopy, intercropping of fast growing species, such as beans or clover, can
help to protect the soil in the initial stage of the main crop.
FIGURE 6-7 - STEPS FOR USING GREEN MANURES, WITH SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER
47
In order to ensure a permanent plant cover it is important to consider the following aspects:
o Timing of soil cultivation
o Timing of planting or sowing
o Producing seedlings and
transplanting them
o Mixed cultivation
o Intercropping
o Cover crops
o Mulching
o Timing of weeding
o Sowing of a green manure crop in the off-season
(Figure 6-8)
o Expected effect on yields
o Availability of suitable species
o Costs of seeds
o Availability of water
o Availability of labour
o Additional use of side-crops
o Reduction of the risk
o Food security
FIGURE 6-8 - 3 POSSIBILITIES OF INTEGRATING GREEN MANURES INTO THE CROP ROTATION
A well-kept field record book is a great help in remembering which crop has in the past been grown in
a particular plot within the field or farm. This is useful especially if the records also show past
incidents of plant pests or diseases in each plot in the farm.
For example, soil diseases and pests can build up during the life of a susceptible crop. If the same crop
or a similar type belonging to the same family is grown in the same field, it will suffer from the
accumulated pests and diseases from the previous crop(s) and may not grow well. This can be avoided
if the soil is left fallow (not cropped) for a while, or a different crop is planted which is tolerant or
resistant to the particular pest or disease. Better still is to plant a crop from a different family which
will not share a same complex of pests and diseases. This will result in decline of soil problems and the
original crop can be grown successfully again.

7. NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Soil is a living system and soil fertility is the key to agricultural productivity. The maintenance of the
fertility of the soil is the primary step in any agricultural system. The plethora of microorganism
inherent in any soil system ensures that nutrient cycle is in place and the large substrate is broken
down to minute particles that can be easy assimilated by the plant’s root system. Therefore farmers
should maintain the inherent soil fertility by replacing the nutrients removed by the crops or livestock
grazing by using green manures, animal manures (raw or composted) and other natural fertilizers
(e.g. rock phosphate).
The input and output of plant nutrients must be monitored through a soil testing program, to ensure
that nutrient depletion does not take place. Soils deficient in nutrient cannot support either crop
production or active populations of beneficial microorganisms, which are essential for a productive
soil. (Figure 7-1 & 7-2).
FIGURE 7-1 - WHY ORGANIC MATTER IS SO IMPORTANT
FIGURE 7-2 - HOW TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN SOIL FERTILITY
SUMMARY
51
Improvement in agricultural sustainability requires, alongside effective water and crop management,
the optimal use and management of soil fertility and soil physical properties (Figure 7-3). Both rely on
soil biological process and soil biodiversity. This requires the adoption of management practices that
enhance soil biological activity and build-up long term soil productivity and health.
FIGURE 7-3 - FACTORS INFLUENCING SOIL FERTILITY
The main practices to enhance soil fertility include the use of organic fertilizers such as (Figure 7-4):
A. Compost and vermicompost
B. Green manures
C. Animal manure
D. Microbial fertilizers
E. Mineral fertilizers
FIGURE 7-4 - HOW TO INCREASE THE CONTENT OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER
52
Composting is the process of transforming organic materials of plant or animal origin into humus in
heaps or pits. Compared with uncontrolled decomposition of organic material, decomposition in the
composting process occurs at a faster rate, reaches higher temperatures and results in a product of
higher quality.
Within the process of composting, three main phases can be distinguished: the heating phase, the
cooling phase and the maturing phase. However, these phases cannot be clearly separated from one
another. (Figure 7-5 & 7-6 and Table 7-1).
1. THE HEATING PHASE:
 Within 3 days of setting up the compost heap, the temperature in the heap rises to 60 to 70 °C and
usually stays at this level for 2–3 weeks. Most of the decomposition occurs during the heating
phase.
 In this phase, it is mainly bacteria which are active. The high temperature is a result of energy
released during conversion of easily decomposable material by the bacteria. The warm
temperature is a typical and important part of the composting process. The heat destroys diseases
pests, weed roots and seeds.
 During this first phase of the composting process, the bacteria have a very high oxygen demand
due to the rapid development of their population. High temperatures in the heap signal that there
is an adequate supply of oxygen for the bacteria. If there is not enough air in the heap, bacterial
development will be hindered and the compost will develop an unpleasant odour.
 Humidity is also essential to the composting process, as bacteria require humid conditions for
their work. The need for water is greatest during the heating phase because of high biological
activity and strong evaporation occurring during this phase.
 As the heat increases, the pH of the compost heap rises (i.e. acidity decreases).
2. THE COOLING PHASE:
 Once the material which is easily digested by the bacteria has been converted, the temperature in
the compost heap declines slowly and will remain at 25–45 °C.
 With the decline in temperature, fungi settle and start the decomposition of straw, fibres and
wooden material. As this decomposition process is slower, the temperature of the heap does not
rise.
 As the temperature drops, the pH of the composting material declines (i.e. acidity increases).
3. THE MATURING PHASE:
 During the maturing phase nutrients are mineralised and humic acids and antibiotics are built-up.
 Red compost worms and other soil organisms start to inhabit the heap during this phase.
 At the end of this phase the compost has lost about half of its original volume, has the colour of
dark, fertile soil and is ready to use.
 The longer it is stored from now on, the more it loses its quality as a fertilizer, while its capacity to
improve soil structure increases.
 In the maturing phase, the compost needs much less water than in the heating phase.

4. DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND METHODS
Compost systems can be divided into «continuously» and «batch-fed» systems:
 Continuously fed systems: These systems do not heat-up during the composting process. They
are handy if there is a continuous supply of wastes (e.g. kitchen waste). However, they lack the
advantages of the heating phase.
 Batch-fed systems (all material is composted at once): These systems lead to a hot composting
process. They offer the advantages of reduced nutrient loss death of weed seeds and diseases as a
result of the high temperature of composting, the process is fast (within a few weeks) and it results
in a compost of superior quality. If little water is available, composting in pits may be more
appropriate since humidity is conserved better in pits than in heaps.
 Vermi-composting: is a method of composting using earthworms. Earthworms speed up the
composting process, aerate the organic material and enhance the finished compost with nutrients
and enzymes from their digestive tracts. Vermicomposting allows you to create compost round the
year, indoor during the winter and outdoor during the summer (Figure 7-7).
FIGURE 7-7 - VERMI-COMPOSTING

Green manures are plants grown to accumulate nutrients for the main crop. When they have built up
maximum biomass, they are worked into the surface soil. As they are usually cut before flowering,
growing a green manure is thus different from growing a legume crop in the rotation. Once worked
into the soil the fresh plant material releases nutrients quickly and will be fully decomposed within a
short period of time. Old or coarse material (e.g. straw, twigs, etc.) will decompose at a slower rate
than fine material and will therefore contribute more to the build-up of soil organic matter than to
fertilizing the crop.
An alternative to sowing a green manure crop in the field is to collect fresh plant material from
elsewhere and work it into the soil. For example, trees and/or shrubs growing alongside crops in an
agroforestry system may provide a large quantity of green material which can be used as green
manure or for mulching (Figure 7-8).
FIGURE 7-8 - HOW TO PRODUCE MORE BIOMASS ON THE FARM
1. GREEN MANURES HAVE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS:
 They penetrate the soil with their roots, make it more friable and bind nutrients, which would
otherwise be washed away.
 They suppress weeds and protect the soil from erosion and direct sunlight.
 If legume plants are used, nitrogen is fixed from the air into the soil.
 Some green manures can be used as fodder plants or even to provide food for human consumption
(e.g. beans and peas).
 By decomposing, green manures release all kinds of nutrients in the correct mixture for the main
crops to utilise thus improving their yield.
 The incorporated plant material encourages the activity of soil organisms, and builds up organic
matter in the soil. This improves soil structure and water holding capacity.
Green manuring is thus an inexpensive way to improve soil fertility and the nutrition of the main crops
grown.
56
2. FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE GROWING GREEN MANURES:
 Labour is required for tillage, sowing, cutting and incorporation of plants into the soil, and is most
intensive where the amount of helpful equipment available is small.
 If green manures are intercropped with the main crops, they compete for nutrients, water and
light.
 When old or coarse plant material is incorporated into the soil, nitrogen may be temporarily
immobilised and therefore unavailable for plant growth.
 If food and space are in short supply it may be more appropriate to grow a food crop rather than a
green manure and recycle the crop residues, or to intercrop a green manure crop with the main
crop.
 The benefits of green manures occur over the long term and are not always visible immediately.
3. HOW TO USE GREEN MANURES
a) Sowing the green manure
 If grown within a crop rotation, the time of sowing must be chosen such that the green manure can
be cut down and worked into the soil before the next crop is sown.
 Green manures need water for germination and growth.
 The ideal seed density must be tested for each individual situation. It depends on the species
chosen.
 In general no additional fertilization is necessary. If legumes are grown in a field for the first time,
inoculation of the seeds with the specific rhizobia may be necessary to profit from nitrogen
fixation of the legume.
b) Working the green manure into the soil (Figure 7-9)
 Timing: The time gap between digging in the green manure and planting the next crop should not
be longer than 2 to 3 weeks, so as to prevent nutrient losses from the decomposing green manure.
 Crushing: Green manures are worked in most easily when the plants are still young and fresh. If
the green manure plants are tall or contain bulky and hard plant parts, it is preferable to chop the
plants into pieces to allow easier decomposition. The older the plants, the longer decomposition
will take. The best time to dig in green manure plants is just before flowering.
 Depth of incorporation: Green manures should not be ploughed deeply into the soil. Instead they
should only be worked in to the surface soil (in heavy soils only 5 to 15 cm deep, in light soils 10 to
maximum 20 cm deep). In warm and humid climates the material can also be left on the soil
surface as a mulch layer.
57
FIGURE 7-9 - STEPS FOR USING GREEN MANURES, WITH SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER
c) How to choose the right species?
There is a large variety of plants, especially legumes that can be used as green manure crops. It is
important that appropriate species are chosen. Most importantly they should be adapted to the local
growing conditions, especially rainfall and soil, fit into the crop rotation and not pose a risk of
transmitting diseases and pests to other crops. (Figure 7-10).
FIGURE 7-10 - CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ''IDEAL'' GREEN MANURE PLANT
58
Depending on whether animals are kept in stables or not (part or full time), farmyard manure consists
of animal excreta and bedding material (usually straw or grass). Farmyard manure is extremely
valuable organic manure.
Some characteristics and effects of farmyard manure:
 It contains large amounts of nutrients.
 Only part of the nitrogen content of manure is directly available to plants, while the remaining
part is released as the manure decomposes. The nitrogen in animal urine is available in the
short-term.
 When dung and urine are mixed, they form a well-balanced source of nutrients for plants. The
availability of phosphorus and potassium from farmyard manure is similar to that from
chemical fertilizers. Chicken manure is rich in phosphorus. However, it is important to be
aware of the origin of the manure, as chicken manure from conventional farms is contaminated
by heavy metals.
 Organic manures contribute to the build-up of soil organic matter and thus improve soil
fertility.
Farmyard manure should ideally be collected and stored for a while so as to obtain a manure of high
quality. The best result is achieved if the farmyard manure is composted. Manure stored under
anaerobic conditions (e.g. in water logged pits) is of inferior quality.
Collection of farmyard manure is easiest if the animals are kept in stables. For storage, the manure
should be mixed with dry plant material (straw, grass, crop residues, leaves etc.) to absorb the liquid.
Straw that has been cut or mashed by spreading it out on a roadside can absorb more water than long
straw.
Usually, the manure is stored next to the stable, either in heaps or in pits. It can also be stored within
the stable as bedding, provided it is covered with fresh bedding material. In any case, the farmyard
manure should be protected from sun, wind and rain. Water logging, as well as drying out should be
avoided, so as to avoid nutrient losses. The storage site should be impermeable and have a slight slope.
Ideally, a trench collects the liquid from the manure heap and the urine from the stable. A dam around
the heap prevents uncontrolled in- and outflow of urine and water.
Storing manure in pits is particularly suitable for dry areas and dry seasons. Storage in pits reduces
the risk of drying out and the need to water the pile. However, there is greater risk of waterlogging and
more effort is required as the pit needs to be dug out. For this method, a 90 cm deep pit is dug with a
slight slope at the bottom. The bottom is compressed and then first covered with straw. The pit is filled
with layers about 30 cm thick and each layer compressed and covered with a thin layer of earth. The
pit is filled up until it stands about 30 cm above ground and then covered with 10 cm of soil.
Humidity in the manure heap must be controlled. To avoid nutrient losses, it should neither be too wet
nor too dry. Some indicators to monitor the humidity of the manure are (Figure 7-11):
 If white fungus appears (threads and white spots), the manure is too dry and should be
dampened with water or urine.
 A yellow-green colour and/or bad smell are signs that the manure is too wet and not
sufficiently aerated.
 If the manure shows a brown to black colour throughout the heap, the conditions are ideal.
59
FIGURE 7-11 - APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF FARMYARD MANURE
The microbial fertilizers mostly consist of organic material and some source of sugar or starch, which
are fermented together with specific species of microorganisms. The products are living organisms
and need to be applied cautiously. They should not be used when expired, since the organisms may be
dead.
Although some research has been done on the use of microorganisms and positive effects may be
proven, there is still little experience with such products. To find out the effect of a certain product, it
is recommended to test them in small scale and compare with an untreated plot. Remember though:
microbial fertilizers cannot substitute an appropriate humus management in the farm.
Most of the bacteria and fungi present in the purchased products are generally present in soil.
Microbial inocula, therefore, enhance the presence of the specific organisms. Some farmers make their
own microbial fertilizers to save on costs (Figure 7-12).
FIGURE 7-12 - HOW TO PREPARE YOUR OWN BIOFERTILIZER (MICROBIAL FERTILIZER)
Some microbes add nutrients to the soil through mineralisation. Others add nitrogen by fixing it from
the atmosphere. These include Rhizobium and Azotobacter. Other microbes, such as Mycorrhizal fungi,
help to supply plants with phosphorus. Azospirillum and Azotobacter are bacteria that can fix nitrogen.
Pseudomonas species are a diverse group of bacteria that can use a wide range of compounds that
plants give off when their roots leak or die. They are able to solubilize phosphorus and may help to
suppress soil borne plant diseases.
60
FIGURE 7-13 - SOME OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS FOUND IN MICROBIAL FERTILIZERS
The mineral fertilizers, which are allowed in organic agriculture, are based on ground natural rock.
However, they may only be used as a supplement to organic manures. If they contain easily soluble
nutrients, they can disturb soil life and result in unbalanced plant nutrition. In some cases, mineral
fertilizers are ecologically questionable as their collection and transport is energy consuming and in
some cases natural habitats are being destroyed.

8. PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Pest and disease management consists of a range of activities that support each other. Most
management practices are long-term activities that aim at preventing pests and diseases from
affecting a crop. Management focuses on keeping existing pest populations and diseases low. Control
on the other and is a short-term activity and focuses on killing pest and disease. The general approach
in organic agriculture to deal with the causes of a problem rather than treating the symptoms also
applies for pest and diseases. Therefore, management is of a much higher priority than control. This
document describes preventive practices, as well as control practices using biological, mechanical
control and natural pesticides.
A healthy plant is less vulnerable to pest and disease infestation. Therefore, a major aim for the
organic farmer is to create conditions which keep a plant healthy (Figure 8-1).
FIGURE 8-1 - FACTORS INFLUENCING PLANT HEALTH
The interaction between living organisms and their environment is crucial for a plant‘s health. Plant’s
health is more at risk in monocultures and on-farm diversification provide a balanced interaction
between different plants and pests and predators. This is why a well-managed ecosystem can be a
successful way of reducing the level of pest or disease population. Certain crop varieties have more
effective mechanisms than others due to the adaptive nature to the environment and therefore have a
lower infection risk.
The health condition of a plant depends to a large extent on the fertility of the soil. When nutrition and
pH is well balanced, the plant becomes stronger and is therefore less vulnerable to infection. Climatic
conditions, such as suitable temperatures and sufficient water supply, are further factors which are
crucial for a healthy plant. If one of these conditions is not suitable, the plant can become stressed.
Stress weakens the defence mechanisms of plants and makes them easy targets for pests and diseases.
One of the most important points for an organic farmer is therefore to grow diverse and healthy plants.
This avoids many pest and disease problems. (Figure 8-2).
SUMMARY
62
FIGURE 8-2 - BASICS OF ORGANIC PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT
Knowledge about plant health and pest and disease ecology helps the farmer to choose effective
preventive crop protection measures. As many factors influence the development of pest and disease,
it’s crucial to step in at the most sensitive points. This can be accomplished through the right timing of
management practices, a suitable combination of different methods, or the choice of a selective
method. Some important preventive crop protection measures are the following ones:
1) Selection of adapted and resistant varieties:
→ Choose varieties which are well adapted to the local environmental conditions (temperature,
nutrient supply, pests and disease pressure), as it allows them to grow healthy and makes them
stronger against infections of pests and diseases.
2) Selection of clean seed and planting material:
→ Use safe seeds which have been inspected for pathogens and weeds at all stages of production.
→ Use planting material from safe sources.
3) Use of suitable cropping systems (see 6. Crop Planning and Management):
→ Mixed cropping systems: can limit pest and disease pressure as the pest has less host plants to
feed on and more beneficial insect life in a diverse system.
→ Crop rotation: reduces the chances of soil borne diseases and increases soil fertility.
→ Green manuring and cover crops: increases the biological activity in the soil and can enhance the
presence of beneficial organisms (but also of pests; therefore a careful selection of the proper
species is needed).
4) Use of balanced nutrient management:
→ Moderate fertilization: steady growth makes a plant less vulnerable to infection. Too much
fertilization may result in salt damage to roots, opening the way for secondary infections.
→ Balanced potassium supply contributes to the prevention of fungi and bacterial infections
5) Input of organic matter:
→ Increases micro-organism density and activity in the soil, thus decreasing population densities of
pathogenic and soil borne fungi.
→ Stabilises soil structure and thus improves aeration and infiltration of water.
→ Supplies substances which strengthen the plant‘s own protection mechanisms.
63
6) Application of suitable soil cultivation methods:
→ Facilitates the decomposition of infected plant parts.
→ Regulates weeds which serve as hosts for pests and diseases.
→ Protects the micro-organisms which regulate soil borne diseases.
7) Use of good water management:
→ No water logging: causes stress to the plant, which encourages pathogens infections.
→ Avoid water on the foliage, as water borne disease spread with droplets and fungal disease
germinate in water.
8) Conservation and promotion of natural enemies:
→ Provide an ideal habitat for natural enemies to grow and reproduce.
→ Avoid using products which harm natural enemies.
9) Selection of optimum planting time and spacing:
→ Most pests or diseases attack the plant only in a certain life stage; therefore it’s crucial that this
vulnerable life stage doesn’t correspond with the period of high pest density and thus that the
optimal planting time is chosen.
→ Sufficient distance between the plants reduces the spread of a disease.
→ Good aeration of the plants allows leaves to dry off faster, which hinders pathogen development
and infection.
10) Use of proper sanitation measures:
→ Remove infected plant parts (leaves, fruits) from the ground to prevent the disease from
spreading.
→ Eliminate residues of infected plants after harvesting.
Regular monitoring of pests, diseases and weeds is the basis for effective management. To be able to
manage pests, diseases and weeds, information is needed on the specific pests, diseases and weeds
present in the region, village or crop fields and the associated damage they cause.
a) Typical signs of pest attacks on crop plants
Most crop pests belong to the insects, mites and nematodes. However, in Africa, mammals (like
elephants, monkeys or voles), and birds (like sparrows, starlings and crows) can also damage crops.
Insect damage can be categorized by biting and chewing (e.g. caterpillars, weevils), piercing and
sucking (e.g. aphids, psyllids) and boring (e.g. borer, leaf miner) species. Some are slow moving (e.g.
caterpillars), fast moving (e.g. fruit flies), hidden (e.g. stem borer), or easy to observe (e.g. caterpillars,
weevils).
 Pest damage is often species-specific: leaves with holes or missing parts is an indication of
caterpillar or weevil damage; curled leaves is an indication of aphids; damaged or rotten fruits are
often caused by larvae of fruit flies; withering plants can also be caused by larvae of noctuids or the
stem borer; and branches or trunks with holes may be an attack by lignivorous insects.
 Mites are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. However, some mite species (spider
mites) weave a typical tissue on attacked plant parts and can, therefore, easily be detected. If mites
are present on plants, leaves and fruits become yellowish.
 Nematodes are also very small and therefore, they are not easy to observe with the naked eye.
They mostly attack plant roots; plants become yellow, wither and die.
64
b) Typical signs of disease attacks on crop plants
Most crop diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria or viruses.
 Fungi cause the great majority, estimated at two-thirds, of infectious plant diseases. They include
all white and true rusts, smuts, needle casts, leaf curls, mildew, sooty moulds and anthracnose. In
addition, they are responsible for most leaf, fruit, and flower spots, cankers, blights, wilts, scabs,
and root, stem, fruit, wood rots among many others. Parts of plants or the total crop plant can
wither and die.
 Bacteria cause any of the four following main problems. Some bacteria produce enzymes that
breakdown the cell walls of plants anywhere in the plant. This causes parts of the plant to start
rotting (known as ‘rot’). Some bacteria produce toxins that are generally damaging to plant tissues,
usually causing early death of the plant. Others produce large amounts of very sticky sugars; as they
travel through the plant, they block the narrow channels preventing water getting from the plant
roots up to the shoots and leaves, again causing rapid death of the plant. Finally, other bacteria
produce proteins that mimic plant hormones. These lead to overgrowth of plant tissue and form
tumours.
 Viruses mostly cause systemic diseases. Generally, leaves show chlorosis or change in colour of
leaves and other green parts. Light green or yellow patches of various shades, shapes and sizes
appear in affected leaves. These patches may form characteristic mosaic patterns, resulting in
general reduction in growth and vigour of the plant.
Careful and continuous monitoring of pest and disease levels during critical times of growth of a crop
is the key to successful management. This can be done through regular scouting of the field by the
farmer. It helps the farmer to intervene early enough before the pest and/or disease cause significant
damage.
FIGURE 8-3 - SCOUTING PATTERN - ZIG-ZAG (OR M-SHAPPED) ROUTE THROUGH THE FIELD
Scouting (Figure 8-3) avoids unnecessary use of natural plant extracts. Limited use of these substances
(e.g. pyrethrum, derris and tobacco) and oils is important as they also have negative effects on
beneficial insects. If the application of these substances is not regulated, many pest predators and
parasitoids may be killed as well. Over application of these substances may also lead to pests
developing resistance. Therefore, scouting should be planned and done in an organised way. It is
important to get a random sample that will be representative of the overall situation in the crop 
65
garden. Therefore, the scout (farmer) needs to observe and record any of the findings for better
decision making.
The most common pattern in pest and disease scouting programs involves walking along a
predetermined zigzag or M-shaped route through a field. This pattern is commonly used because it is
easy to teach, convenient to use, and ensures that all regions of the field are visited. To monitor insect
pests, different traps can also be used (Figure 8-4 & 8-5). The simple idea is to know more about the
presence of the insect pests in the field especially the fast moving (mobile) insect pests (e.g. fruit flies,
lepidopteran pests).
 Fruit flies can be captured using bait traps. For example, PE-bottles with small holes can be halffilled with water, some cattle urine, fruit flesh or a small dead fish and a drop of detergent or
soapy water. These bottles are then hung in trees and checked every three days.
 Yellow plastic cards coated with adhesive are also good for trapping aphids and leafhopper.
Yellow-orange plastic boards are appropriate for white flies, while blue cards are appropriate for
thrips monitoring.
 Light traps are especially needed where noctuids (e.g. moths, cutworms, African armyworm, and
cotton bollworm) are a problem. Within crops attacked by cutworms, visual checks of caterpillars
have to be done by dawn.
FIGURE 8-4 - TRAPS TO MONITOR INSECT PESTS
FIGURE 8-5 - HOW TO MAKE A FRUIT FLY TRAP
66
Organic management and control of diseases is based strongly on strengthening the plant with the aim
of enhancing its self-defence and thereby preventing the outbreak of the disease. One typical
expression of induced resistance is the thickening of cell walls of the plant, which interferes with
pathogen entering the cell. Another is the dying of the infested cell walls, which causes the pathogen to
die also, and thus reduce its spread.
There are several resistance-inducing substances that can be prepared by the farmers themselves.
Some are plant extracts made from efeu (Hedera helix), rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum), or giant
knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis).
Compost teas and herbal teas are tools that can be made on the farm to enhance crop health and
fertility, and to inoculate the leaves and roots with soluble nutrients, beneficial microorganisms, and
beneficial metabolites (products that aid in the growth and development of plants).
Compost extract is a fertilizer, but it also can induce plant resistance. For its preparation, mature
compost is mixed with water at a ratio of 1:5 to 1:8 (vol/vol: 1L of compost for every 5 to 8 L of water)
and well stirred before it is left to ferment for 3-7 days. One spoonful of molasses can be added per
litre of liquid, because this enhances the development of the microorganisms. The fermentation site
should be shaded and safe from the rain. After the fermentation period and before the application, the
extract is well stirred, then filtered and diluted at a ratio of 1:5 to 1:10.
Plant extracts can be obtained from stinging nettle, horsetail, comfrey, clover, seaweed and others,
alone or mixed with marine by-products such as fish waste or fishmeal. Dilutions of 1:10 or 1:5 are
used as foliar spray or soil drench.
As a general rule it is recommended to apply compost extracts or teas every 7 to 10 days to prevent
diseases from developing and as a way to enhance soil microorganisms.
The natural enemies of pests are other organisms (fungi, bacteria, viruses, insect predators, and insect
parasitoids) which kill pest. Therefore, the organic farmer should try to conserve natural enemies
already present in the crop environment and enhance their impact. This can be achieved with the
following methods:
 Minimize the application of natural pesticides (chemical pesticides anyway are not per-mitted in
organic farming).
 Allow some pests to live in the field which will serve as food or host for natural enemies.
 Establish a diverse cropping system (e.g. mixed cropping).
 Include host plants providing food or shelter for natural enemies (e.g. flowers which adult
beneficial insects feed on).
There are many possibilities to enhance floral diversity within and along the boundaries of crop fields
(Figure 8-6):
 Hedges - Use indigenous shrubs known to attract pest predators and parasitoids by offering
nectar, pollen, alternative hosts and/or preys. Most flowering shrub species have this property.
However, care should be taken to not use plant species known to be alternative hosts of pests or
diseases.
67
 Beetle banks - Strips of grass in the neighbourhood of crop fields harbour different natural pest
enemy groups like carabids, staphylinid beetles and spiders. In order to lower the risk of weeds
and plants known as host plants of crop pests and diseases, one to three native grass species can
be sown in strips of 1 to 3 m.
 Flower strips - Use indigenous flowering plant species known to attract predators and
parasitoids by offering nectar, pollen, alternative hosts and/or preys. Most flowering plant species
have this property. However, care should be taken not to use alternative hosts of pests or diseases.
Three to five native flowering plant species can be sown in well-prepared seed beds, arranged in
strips of 1 to 3 m on the boundary of the crop field. After flowering, seeds can be collected to
renew the strip or create new ones.
 Companion plants - Natural pest enemies can also be attracted by companion plants within a
crop. These companion plant species can be the same as used in the flower strips. A few (1 or 2
per 10 m2) flowering companion plants within a crop serve as a ‘service station’ for natural pest
enemies.
FIGURE 8-6 - ENHANCING BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
Mass-trapping of pests is an additional control measure. They often can easily be built with cheap
material. Some examples include:
 Light traps can be used to catch moths such as armyworms, cutworms, stem borers and other
night flying insects. Light traps are more efficient when placed soon after the adult moths start to
emerge but before they start laying eggs. However, light traps have the disadvantage of attracting a
wide range of insect species. Most of the attracted insects are not pests. In addition, many insects
that are attracted to the area around the light traps (sometimes from considerable distances) do
not actually fly into the trap. Instead, they remain nearby, actually increasing the total number of
insects in the immediate area.
 Colour and water traps can be used to monitor adult thrips. In some cases thrips can even be
reduced by mass trapping with coloured (blue, yellow or white) sticky traps or water traps in the
nursery or field. The colour spectrum of the boards is important for the efficacy of the sticky traps.
Bright colours attract more thrips than darker ones. Sticky traps with cylindrical surfaces are more 
68
efficient that flat surfaces. They are best placed within a meter of crop level. Traps should not be
placed near the borders of fields or near shelter belts.
 Water traps should be at least 6 cm deep with a surface area of 250 to 500 cm2, and preferably
round, with the water level about 2 cm below the rim. A few drops of detergent added to the water
ensure that thrips sink and do not drift to the edges and escape. Replace or add water regularly.
 Yellow sticky traps can be used to control whiteflies, aphids and leaf mining flies. Yellow plastic
gallon containers mounted upside down on sticks coated with transparent car grease or used
motor oil, is one such trap. These should be placed in and around the field at about 10 cm above
the foliage. Clean and re-oil when traps are covered with flies. Yellow sticky boards have a similar
effect. To use, place 2 to 5 yellow sticky cards per 500 m2 field area. Replace traps at least once a
week. To make your own sticky trap, spread petroleum jelly or used motor oil on yellow painted
plywood (size 30 cm x 30 cm). Place traps near the plants but faraway enough to prevent the
leaves from sticking to the board. Note that the yellow colour attracts many insect. Note that the
yellow colour attracts many insect species, including beneficial insects, so use yellow traps only
when necessary.
 Fruit bagging prevents fruit flies from laying eggs on the fruits (Figure 8-7). In addition, the bag
provides physical protection from mechanical injuries (scars and scratches). Although laborious, it
is cheap, safe and gives a more reliable estimate of the projected harvest. Bagging works well with
melon, bitter gourd, mango, guava, star fruit, avocadoes and banana (plastic bags used).
FIGURE 8-7 - FRUIT BAGGING
Recommendations to farmers regarding fruit bagging: Cut old newspapers to fruit size and
double the layers, as single layers break apart easily. Fold and sew or staple the sides and bottom
of the sheets to make a rectangular bag. Blow in the bag to inflate it. Insert one fruit per bag then
close the bag and firmly tie the top end of the bag with sisal string, wire and banana fibre or
coconut midrib. Push the bottom of the bag upwards to prevent fruit from touching the bag. For
example, start bagging the mango fruit 55 to 60 days from flower bloom or when the fruits are
about the size of a chicken egg. When using plastic bags (e.g. with bananas), open the bottom or cut
a few small holes to allow moisture to dry up. Moisture trapped in the plastic bags damages and/or
promotes fungal and bacterial growth that causes diseased fruits. Plastic also overheats the fruit.
Bags made of dried plant leaves are good alternatives to plastic.
69
Biological control is the use of natural enemies to manage populations of pests (such as ladybird
beetles, predatory gallmidges, hoverfly larvae against aphids and psyllids) and diseases (Figure 8-8).
This implies that we are dealing with living systems, which are complex and vary from place to place
and from time to time.
FIGURE 8-8 - POPULATION DYNAMICS OF PESTS AND PREDATORS
If populations of natural enemies present in the field are too small to sufficiently control pests, they
can be reared in a laboratory or rearing unit. The reared natural enemies are released in the crop to
boost field populations and keep pest populations down. There are two approaches to biological
control through the release of natural enemies:
 Preventive release of the natural enemies at the beginning of each season. This is used when the
natural enemies could not persist from one cropping season to another due to unfavourable
climate or the absence of the pest. Populations of the natural enemy then establish and grow
during the season.
 Releasing natural enemies when pest populations start to cause damage to crops (Figure 8-9).
Pathogens are usually used in that way, because they cannot persist and spread in the crop
environment without the presence of a host (“pest”). They are also often inexpensive to produce.
FIGURE 8-9 - RELEASING NATURAL ENEMIES
70
Natural enemies that kill or suppress pests or diseases are often fungi or bacteria. They are called
antagonists or referred to as microbial insecticides or bio-pesticides. Some commonly used
antagonistic microbes are:
 Bacteria such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Bt has been available as a commercial microbial
insecticide since the 1960s. Different types of Bt are available for the control of caterpillars and
beetles in vegetables and other agricultural crops, and for mosquito and black fly control. The bestknown biocontrol agent used in field crops is the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and
Bacillus thuringiensis. var. aizawai against diverse lepidopteran pests, and the Bacillus thuringiensis
var israeliensis against mosquitoes. Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki is produced in local factories
in different African countries (e.g. South Africa, Kenya and Mozambique) and can be used against
different pests (African armyworm, African bollworm, bean armyworm, beet armyworm, cabbage
webworm, cabbage moth, cabbage looper, cotton leafworm, diamondback moth, giant looper, green
looper, spiny bollworm, spotted bollworm, pod borers, tomato looper).
 Viruses such as NPV (nuclearpolyhedrosis virus), effective for control of several cater-pillar pest
species. Every insect species, however, requires a specific NPV-species. An example: The
armyworm Spodoptera exigua is a major problem in shallot production in Indonesia. Since
experiments showed that SeNPV (NPV specific for S. exigua) provided better control than
insecticides, farmers have adopted this control method. Many farmers in West-Sumatra are now
producing NPV on-farm.
 Fungi that kill insects, such as Beauveria bassiana. Different strains of this fungus are
commercially available. For example: strain Bb 147 is used for control of corn borers (Ostrinia
nubilalis and O. furnacaiis) in maize, strain GHA is used against whitefly, thrips, aphids and
mealybugs in vegetables and ornamentals. Several species of fungi can occur naturally in
ecosystems. For example, aphids can be killed by a green or white coloured fungus during humid
weather.
 Fungi that work against plant-pathogens. Some examples include: Trichoderma sp., widely used
in Asia for prevention of soil-borne diseases such as damping-off and root rots in vegetables (Figure
8-10). Some Trichogramma species against the African bollworm are bred in some laboratories in
Africa against lepidopteran pests and aphids. A successful introduction of the neotropical
parasitoid Apoanagyrus lopezi against the cassava mealybug (Phenacoccus manihoti) caused a
satisfactory reduction of P. manihoti in most farmers’ fields in Africa. This is one of the success
stories of classical biocontrol.
FIGURE 8-10 - BIOCONTROL OF PLANT DISEASES BY NON-PATHOGENIC FUNGI
 Entomopathogenic nematodes against different weevil species (e.g. Steinernema carpocapsae,
Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) and to control soil insects like cutworms (Agrotis spp.) in vegetables. 
71
Some plants contain components that are toxic to insects. When extracted from the plants and applied
on infested crops, these components are called botanical pesticides or botanicals. The use of plant
extracts to control pests is not new. Rotenone (Derris sp.), nicotine (tobacco), and pyrethrins
(Chrysanthemum sp.) have been used widely both in small-scale subsistence farming as well as in
commercial agriculture.
Most botanical pesticides are contact, respiratory, or stomach poisons. Therefore, they are not very
selective, but target a broad range of insects. This means that even beneficial organisms can be
affected. Yet the toxicity of botanical pesticides is usually not very high and their negative effects on
beneficial organisms can be significantly reduced by selective application. Furthermore, botanical
pesticides are generally highly bio-degradable, so that they become inactive within hours or a few days.
This reduces again the negative impact on beneficial organisms and they are relatively
environmentally safe compared to chemical pesticides (Figure 8-11).
FIGURE 8-11 - THE IMPACT OF CHEMICAL PESTICIDES ON NATURAL ENEMIES
The preparation and use of botanicals requires some know-how, but not much material and
infrastructures. It’s a common practice under many traditional agricultural systems. Some commonly
used botanicals are:
 NEEM: Neem derived from the neem tree (Azadiracta indica) of arid tropical regions, contains
several insecticidal compounds. The main active ingredient is azadiractin, which both deters and
kills many species of caterpillars, thrips and whitefly. Both seeds and leaves can be used to prepare
the neem solution. Neem seeds contain a higher amount of neem oil, but leaves are available all
year. A neem solution loses its effectiveness within about 8 hours after preparation, and when
exposed to direct sunlight. It is most effective to apply neem in the evening, directly after
preparation, under humid conditions or when the plants and insects are damp. There exist different
recipes for the preparation of a neem solution.
Recommendation to farmers about preparation of neem pesticides: In Ghana, Africa, neem
seed kernel extract was tested on cabbage in Farmer trainings and had a very good repelling effect
on diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). Here is their recipe: Pound 30 g neem kernels (that is 
72
the seed of which the seed coat has been removed) and mix it in 1 L of water. Leave it overnight.
The next morning, filter the solution through a fine cloth and use it immediately for spraying. It
should not be further diluted.
Neem cake (ground neem seed or neem kernel powder) has also a considerable potential as a
fertilizer and at the same time it will hinder nematode attacks of the crop roots (e.g. tomato). Put
neem cake in the planting pit (200g per m2) and mix it with substrate. The neem cake will repel and
even kill nematodes and other root pests. Insecticidal agents (azadirachtin) will be translocated to
above-ground parts of the plant and help to get rid of pests there. (figure 8-12).
FIGURE 8-12 - PREPARATION OF A NEEM SOLUTION
 PYRETHRUM: Pyrethrum is a daisy-like Chrysanthemum. In the tropics, pyrethrum is grown in
mountain areas because it needs cool temperatures to develop its flowers. Pyrethrins are
insecticidal chemicals extracted from the dried pyrethrum flower. The flower heads are processed
into a powder to make a dust. This dust can be used directly or infused into water to make a spray.
Pyrethrins cause immediate paralysis to most insects. Low doses do not kill but have a “knock
down” effect. Stronger doses kill. Pyrethrins break down very quickly in sunlight so they should be
stored in darkness. Both highly alkaline and highly acid conditions speed up degradation so
pyrethrins should not be mixed with lime or soap solutions. Liquid formulations are stable in
storage but powders may lose up to 20% of their effectiveness in one year.
Recommendation to farmers about preparation of Pyrethrum pesticides: Pyrethrum powder
is made with dried ground flowers. Use pure or mix with a carrier such as talc, lime or
diatomaceous earth and sprinkle over infested plants. To make liquid pyrethrum extract (mix 20 g
pyrethrum powder with 10 L of water), add soap to make the substance more effective. Strain and
apply immediately as a spray. For best effects this should be applied in the evening. Pyrethrum can
also be extracted by alcohol.
 CHILLIPEPPER: Chillies and capsicum pepper have both repellent and insecticidal effects.
Recommendations to farmers on preparation of chilli pesticides: To make the chilli extract
grind 200 g of chillies into a fine dust, boil it in 4 L water, add another 4 L of water and a few drops
of liquid soap. This mixture can be sprayed against aphids, ants, small caterpillars and snails.
73
 GARLIC: Garlic has antifeedant (insect stop feeding), insecticidal, nematicidal and repellent
properties. Garlic is reportedly effective against a wide range of insects at different stages in their
life cycle (egg, larvae, adult) (Figure 8-13). This includes ants, aphids, armyworms, diamondback
moth, whitefly, wireworm and termites. Garlic is non-selective, has a broad-spectrum effect and
can kill beneficial insects as well. Therefore, it should be used with caution.
FIGURE 8-13 - THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE RICE YELLOW STEM BORER
Recommendations to farmers on preparation of garlic pesticides: To make the garlic extract,
grind or chop 100 g garlic into 0,5 L of water. Allow mixture to stand for 24 hours, add 0,5 L of
water and stir in liquid soap. Dilute at 1:20 with water and spray in the evening. To improve
efficacy, chilli extract can be added.
There are many other extracts of plants known to have insecticidal effects like tobacco (Nicotiana
tabacum), yellow root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima), fish bean (Tephrosia vogelii), violet tree (Securidaca
longepedunculata), and nasturtium (Nasturtium trapaeolum) which are traditionally used to control
pests in Africa.
Anise, chillies, chives, garlic, coriander, nasturtium, spearmint and marigold are plants known to have
a repellent effect on different pest insects (aphids, moths, root flies, etc.) and can be grown as
intercrop or at the border of crop fields (Figure 8-14). Marigold is especially known to deter root
nematodes, while neem cake is known to deter mice.
FIGURE 8-14 - TRAP CROPPING - TRAP INTERCROPPING
74
- Despite being “natural” and widely used in agricultural systems, some botanicals may be dangerous
for humans and they can be very toxic to natural enemies. Nicotine for example, derived from the
tobacco plant, is one of the most toxic organic poisons for humans and other warm-blooded animals.
Pyrethrins are not poisonous for humans and warm-blooded animals. However, human allergic
reactions are common. It can cause rash, and breathing the dust can cause headaches and sickness.
- Before a new botanical pesticide is applied in a large scale, its effect on the ecosystem should be
tested in a small field experiment. Do not just use botanical pesticides as a default option! First
understand the ecosystem and how botanicals influence it!
- Do not have direct skin contact with the crude extract during the process of preparation and
application.
- Contact with plant extracts should be avoided in the eyes.
- Make sure that you place the plant extract out of reach of children during storage.
- Wear protective clothing (eyes, mouth, nose and skin) while applying the extract.
- Wash your hands after handling the plant extract.
Besides extractions of plants, there are some other natural pesticides, which are allowed in organic
farming. Although some of these products have limited selectivity and are not fully biodegradable,
there are situations, when their use is justified. However, in most cases, the desired effect is best
reached in combination with preventive crop protection methods. Some examples are:
 Soft soap solutions: against aphids and other sucking insects.
 Light mineral oil: against various insect pests (harms natural enemies!).
 Sulphur: against spider mites (harms natural enemies!). The acaricidal effect of sulphur is best
at temperatures above 12° C. However, sulphur has the potential to cause plant injury in dry
hot weather (above 32° C). It’s also incompatible with other pesticides. Sulphur should not be
used together or after treatments with oil to avoid phytotoxicity.
 Plant ashes: wood ashes from fire places can be efficient against ants, leaf miners, stem borers,
termites and potato moths. Ash should be dusted directly on pest colonies and infested plant
parts. The ash will dehydrate the soft bodied pests. Wood ashes are often used when storing
grains to deter storage pests such as weevils. In addition, ashes are used against soil borne
diseases.
 Sulphur is mostly used against plant diseases like powdery mildew, downy mildew and other
diseases. The key to its efficacy is that it prevents spore germination. For this reason, it must be
applied prior to disease development for effective results. Sulphur can be applied as a dust or in
liquid form. It is not compatible with other pesticides. Lime-sulphur is formed when lime is added
to sulphur to help it penetrate plant tissue. It is more effective than elemental sulphur at lower
concentrations. However, the odour of rotten eggs usually discourages its use over extensive fields.
 Bordeaux mixture (Copper sulphate and lime) has been successfully used for over 150 years, on
fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. Unlike sulphur, Bordeaux mixture is both fungicidal and
bactericidal. As such, it can be effectively used against diseases such as leaf spots caused by
bacteria or fungi, powdery mildew, downy mildew and various anthracnose pathogens. The ability
of Bordeaux mixture to persist through rains and to adhere to plants is one reason it has been so 
75
effective. Bordeaux mixture contains copper sulphate, which is acidic, and neutralized by lime
(calcium hydroxide), which is alkaline.
Recommendations to farmers on preparation of Bordeaux mixture: Bordeaux mixture comes
in several formulations. One of the most popular, effective and least phytotoxic formulations for
general use is the following formulation: Mix 90 g of blue copper sulphate with 4,5 L of water (in a
non-metallic container). In another non-metallic container, mix 125 grams of slaked lime with 4.5
litres of water. Stir both, mix both solutions, and stir again. This formulation was developed in
recognition of the fact that copper, like sulphur, is phytotoxic and that the level of toxicity is
related to the age of plant tissue being treated. Application of Bordeaux during hot weather (above
85° F or 30° C) may cause yellowing and leaf drop. Additionally, leaf burn can occur if it rains soon
after a Bordeaux application. Care should be taken when applying this fungicide to young, tender
leaves of fruit trees. Do not apply Bordeaux mixture to corn or sorghum, which are described as
copper-sensitive plants. There are other, very common and cheap copper formulations available:
copper hydroxide and copper oxychloride. They are accepted in organic farming provided that the
number of applications is strictly followed and a proper soil amendment is observed to prevent
copper accumulation in the soil.
 Acidic clays have a fungicidal effect due to aluminium oxide or aluminium sulphate as active
agents. They are used as an alternative to copper products but, are often less efficient.
 Milk has also been used against blights, mildew, mosaic viruses and other fungal and viral diseases.
Spraying every 10 days with a mixture of 1 L of milk to 10 to 15 L of water is effective.
 Baking soda has been used to control mildew and rust diseases on plants. Spray with a mixture of
100 g of baking or washing soda with 50 g of soft soap. Dilute with 2 L of water. Spray only once
and leave as long gaps as possible (several months). Do not use during hot weather and test the
mixture on a few leaves because of possible phytotoxic effects.
Many plant extracts are known to have fungicidal effects. Onion and garlic are effective against many
diseases such as mildew and fungal and bacterial diseases. Mexican and African marigold act as a crop
“strengthener” to help potatoes, beans, tomatoes and peas resist fungal diseases such as mildew. The
leaves of pawpaw (Carica papaya) and sweet basil have a general fungicidal effect. Many other plant
species are known to have fungicidal effects. Traditional knowledge might be of help to amend the
range of plant extracts in each region.

9. WEED MANAGEMENT
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Organic farmers give first priority to prevention of the introduction and multiplication of weeds. The
management practices aim at keeping the weed population at a level that does not result in economic
loss of the crop cultivation or harm its quality. The goal is not to completely eradicate all weeds, as
they also have a role to play on the farm. For example, weeds provide cover that reduces soil erosion.
In addition, most of the biological diversity in our crop fields comes from the presence of weeds. They
provide habitat for both beneficial biocontrol insects and mycorrhiza fungi. Because weeds offer
pollen and nectar they allow biocontrol insects to maintain their populations and, therefore, serve as a
valuable instrument in controlling pests.
However, weeds may also alter the environment of the crop in a negative way. Light and air circulation,
for example, are reduced between the crop plants. In this darker and more humid environment,
diseases find ideal conditions in which to spread and infect plants.
As we have seen many times up to this point, a basic working principle in organic farming is to
prevent problems, rather than to cure them. This applies equally to weed management. Good weed
management in organic farming includes creating conditions which hinder weeds from growing at the
wrong time and in the wrong place and then become a serious problem for the crop cultivation.
Competition by weeds doesn’t harm the crop throughout the whole cultivation period in the same way.
The most sensitive phase of a crop to weed competition is in its early growth stage. A young plant is
vulnerable and depends highly on an ideal nutrient, light, and water supply for a good development. If
it has to compete with weeds at this stage, the crop may grow weak, which also makes it more
vulnerable to pest and disease infections.
Weed competition later in the cultivation period is less harmful. However, some weeds may cause
harvesting problems and reduce the crop yield in that way. Therefore, weeds should not be completely
ignored after the most critical growth period of the crop, but in general, they become less important.
These considerations should influence the selection and timing of weed management measures. In
general, such measures aim at keeping the weed population at a level which doesn’t result in economic
loss of the crop cultivation or harm its quality.
Several preventive measures may be applied at the same time (Figure 9-2 & 9-4). The importance and
effectiveness of the different methods depend to a large extent on the weed species and the
environmental conditions. However, some methods are very effective for a wide range of weeds and
are therefore regularly used:
 Choice of crops and varieties: tall crops and varieties with broader leaves will compete better
with late occurring weeds than small varieties with narrow leaves. Some varieties will inhibit and
suppress weeds while others will tolerate them. For example, there are witchweed (Striga)
resistant maize and cowpea cultivars in many countries of Africa, which give better performance at
the same level of weeds where other varieties are more affected (Figure 9-1).
SUMMARY
77
FIGURE 9-1 - STRIGA ON A HOST PLANT WHICH SHOWS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES
 Mulching: the weeds find it difficult to receive enough light to grow and may not be able to pass
through the mulch layer. Dry, hardy material, that decomposes slowly, keeps its effect longer than
fresh mulch material.
 Living green cover: The cover competes successfully against the weeds for light, nutrients, and
water and therefore helps to prevent weed growth by winning the competition for resources. The
cover crops usually used are legumes, which improves soil fertility on top of suppressing weeds.
For example, a ground cover of desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum) or silver leaf, inter-seeded
among maize, reduces striga weed and fixes nitrogen at the same time.
 Crop rotation: Rotation of crops is the most efficient measure to regulate seed and root weeds.
Changing the conditions of the crop interrupts the living conditions of the weeds thus inhibiting
their growth and spread.
 Intercropping (mixed cropping and under-sowing): Intercropping with fast growing weedsuppressive species (“smoother crop” or “living mulch”) between rows of main crop species is
effective in weed control. There are different examples known to work in Africa, for example,
sowing cowpeas and egusi melons or pumpkins as intercrops in cassava to reduce weed occurrence.
FIGURE 9-2 - CULTURAL PRACTICES OF MANAGING WEEDS
78
 Sowing time and density: Optimum growing conditions enhance the optimum crop plant
development and their ability to compete against weeds. Proper crop spacing will ensure that
minimum space is available for the growth of weeds and will minimize competition with weeds.
This will effectively restrict weed development. In order to apply this approach, the limiting weeds
must be known and the seasons in which they occur. A weed calendar of the area or region, if
available, might be of help. It will be used to manage weeds in a targeted fashion with proper timing
and effect.
 Balanced fertilization: it can support an ideal growth of the crop, which promotes the growth of
the crop over the weeds.
 Soil cultivation methods can influence the total weed pressure as well as the composition of
weeds. For example, minimum-tillage systems can increase the weed pressure. Because weed
seeds can germinate between soil cultivation and sowing of the crop, weed cures before sowing can
be effective at reducing weed pressure. Use of superficial stubble treatment works against
persisting weeds. It should be done under dry weather conditions to allow the weed roots which
have been brought to the surface to dry out.
 Pasturing: in perennial crops like coffee, mangoes, avocadoes or cocoa, the use of sheep and goats
to reduce rampant weed growth is becoming common. In case of cattle, broadleaf weeds tend to
predominate due to the cattle preference for grasses. Therefore, it is necessary to rotate with sheep
and goats which prefer broadleaves to overcome this selective grazing (Figure 9-3).
FIGURE 9-3 - PASTURING FOR WEED CONTROL
 Prevent dissemination of weeds by eliminating them before seed dispersal.
 Prevent insemination of crops by weeds by avoiding the introduction of weed seeds into the fields
through tools or animals; and by using only weed free seed material.
79
FIGURE 9-4 - HOW TO PREVENT WEEDS
The soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum (different isolates from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger) is
very effective in reducing the witch weed (Striga hermonthica and S. asiatica) in different cereal crops,
leading to yield increases in scientific trials. Other Fusarium species found in Sudan and Ghana are
very effective, too (Fusarium nygamai, F. oxysporum and F. solani). This mycoherbicide is on the way to
being formulated and registered in different countries in Africa.
Rhizobacteria capable of suppressing germination of witch weed (Striga spp.) seeds or actually
destroying the seeds are particularly promising biological control agents since they can be easily and
cheaply formulated into seed inoculants. Pseudomonas fluorescens putida isolates significantly
inhibited germination of Striga hermonthica seeds. However, currently no biocontrol product is
available.
With the necessary preventive measures, weed density can be reduced, but it will hardly be enough
during the critical periods of the crop at the beginning of cultivation. Therefore, mechanical methods
remain an important part of weed management (Figure 9-5).
Manual weeding is probably the most important one. As it’s very labour intensive, reducing weed
density as much as possible in the field will bring less work later on and should therefore be aimed at.
There are different tools to dig, cut and uprooting the weeds; hand, ox-drawn and tractor-drawn tools.
Using the right tool can increase work efficiency significantly.
Weeding should be done before the weeds flower and produce seeds.
Flame weeding is another option: Plants are heated briefly to 100°C and higher. This provokes
coagulation of the proteins in the leaves and a bursting of their cell walls. Consequently, the weed dries
out and dies. Although it is an effective method, it is quite expensive, as it consumes a large amount of
fuel gas and needs machinery. It is not effective against root weeds.

10. SOIL CULTIVATION AND TILLAGE
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Soil cultivation includes all mechanical measures to loosen, turn or mix the soil, such as ploughing,
tilling, digging, hoeing, harrowing etc. Careful soil cultivation can improve the soil‘s capacity to retain
water, its aeration, capacity of infiltration, warming up, evaporation etc. But soil cultivation can also
harm the soil fertility as it accelerates erosion and the decomposition of humus. There is not one right
way to cultivate the soil, but a range of options. Depending on the cropping system and the soil type,
appropriate soil cultivation patterns must be developed.
There are many reasons for cultivating the soil. The most important ones are to (Figure 10-1):
• Loosen the soil to facilitate the penetration of plant roots
• Improve the aeration (nitrogen and oxygen from the air)
• Encourage the activity of the soil organisms
• Increase infiltration of water
• Reduce evaporation
• Destroy or control weeds and soil pests
• Incorporate crop residues and manures into the soil
• Prepare the site for seeds and seedlings
• Repair soil compaction caused by previous activities
FIGURE 10-1 - FACTORS INFLUENCING SOIL FERTILITY
Any soil cultivation activity has a more or less destructive impact on soil structure. In tropical soils,
regular tillage accelerates the decomposition of organic matter which can lead to nutrient losses. The
mixing of soil layers can severely harm certain soil organisms. Soil after tillage is very prone to soil
erosion if left uncovered before the onset of heavy rains (Figure 10-2).
SUMMARY
82
Minimum tillage systems on the other side help to build up a natural soil structure with a crumbly top
soil rich in organic matter and full of soil organisms. Nutrient losses are reduced to a minimum as
there is no sudden decomposition of organic matter and nutrients are caught by a dense network of
plant roots. Soil erosion won‘t be a problem as long as there is a permanent plant cover or sufficient
input of organic material. Last but not least, farmers can save a lot of labour (Figure 10-3).
FIGURE 10-2 - SIGNS FOR SOIL EROSION
FIGURE 10-3 - HOW TO PREVENT SOIL EROSION
Upper left: subsoil of low fertility and dark fertile topsoil; upper right: stones
elevated from the soil due to erosion; bottom left: severe erosion in a new tea
plantation; bottom right: Gully erosion in ginger cultivation
83
Thus, each organic farmer will have to assess the soil cultivation practice which is most suitable for
his/her conditions. To minimize the negative impacts of soil cultivation while benefiting from its
advantages, the organic farmer should aim on reducing the number of interventions to the minimum
and choose methods that conserve the natural qualities of the soil.
FIGURE 10-4 - ADVANTAGES OF SOIL CULTIVATION AND ZERO-TILLAGE SYSTEMS
If soils are cultivated in wet conditions or burdened with heavy machinery, there is a risk of soil
compaction which results in suppressed root growth, reduced aeration and water logging (Figure 10-
5).
Where soil compaction is a potential problem, farmers should be aware of the following aspects:
• The risk of soil compaction is highest when the soil structure is disturbed in wet conditions
• Do not drive vehicles on your land soon after rains
• Ploughing of wet soils can lead to a smearing of the plough sole
• Soils rich in sand are less prone to soil compaction than soils rich in clay
• High content of soil organic matter reduce the risk of soil compaction
• It is very difficult to restore a good soil structure once soil compaction took place
FIGURE 10-5 - SOIL COMPACTION
84
Depending on the aim of the soil cultivation, different cultivation practices are implemented during
different stages of the cropping cycle: after harvesting, before sowing or planting or while the crop
stands.
In order to accelerate decomposition, the residues of the previous crop are incorporated into the soil
before preparing the seedbed for the next crop. Crop residues, green manure crops and farmyard
manure should be worked only into the topsoil layer (15 to 20 cm), as decomposition in deeper soil
layers is incomplete, producing growth inhibiting substances which can harm the next crop.
In annual crops or new plantations, primary tillage is usually done with a plough or a similar
instrument. As a principle, soil cultivation should achieve a flat turning of the top soil and a loosening
of the medium deep soil. Deep turning soil cultivation mixes the soil layers, harms soil organisms and
disturbs the natural structure of the soil.
Before sowing or planting, secondary soil cultivation is done to crush and smoothen the ploughed
surface. Seedbed preparation has the purpose to provide enough loose soil of appropriate clod size. If
weed pressure is high, seedbeds can be prepared early thus allowing weed seeds to germinate before
the crop is sown. Shallow soil cultivation after some days is sufficient to eliminate the young weed
seedlings. Where water logging is a problem, seedbeds can be established as mounds or ridges.
Once the crop is established, shallow soil cultivation (e.g. by hoeing) helps to suppress weeds. It also
enhances the aeration of the soil and at the same time reduces the evaporation of soil moisture from
the deeper soil layers. When crops are temporarily lacking nutrients, shallow soil cultivation can
stimulate the decomposition of organic matter, thus making nutrients available.
EXAMPLE: Minimum and zero-tillage in Honduras (Adapted from: “Manual de agricultura
biológica”,1999. Kolmans, E. & Vasquez, D.)
Farmers in the coastal region of Honduras are practising the following minimum tillage
system:
• First, the vegetation is cut down to the soil level.
• Then the soil is opened along contour lines at plant row distance.
• Organic manure is applied into the rows.
• The crop is sown into these rows.
• The vegetation in between is cut regularly and used as a mulch.
• This system can be combined with leguminous plants which act as cover crops.
In the same region, also a zero tillage system is practised by sowing maize and corn directly
into the residues of the previous crop:
• Corn is sown into the mulch layer
• 1-2 months later the beans are sown.
• After the corn is harvested, the residues are left on the field and the beans grow over them.
• The beans offer suitable conditions for a direct sowing of the following corn crop.
• With this method, two corn crops and two bean crops per year are grown with satisfying yields
85
With both methods, farmers observe higher total yields, less soil erosion, less weeds and a great
reduction of the work load.
(Figure 10-6)
• Tools for primary cultivation: pole plough, mouldboard plough, digging fork, spade
• Tools for secondary cultivation: cultivators, harrows, rakes
• Tools for inter-row cultivation: inter-row cultivators, hoes
• Tools for land forming: ridgers, hoes
FIGURE 10-6 - SOME EXAMPLES OF SOIL CULTIVATION TOOLS (SOURCE. TOOLS FOR AGRICULTURE, CTA & GRET).
Tools should be chosen considering the soil cultivation purpose, the soil type, the crop and the
available power source. Therefore, it is difficult to make general recommendations.

11. PLANT PROPAGATION
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
The choice of high quality organic seed and plant propagation material of suitable varieties is an
important key to successful organic farming, allowing for improved yield and product quality, for crop
resilience, considerate use of non-renewable resources and for increased genetic and species diversity.
This practice describes the principles of plant propagation in organic farming, as well as the
importance of the use of traditional varieties and their conservation.
Ideally, all plant production should be based on organically-bred and organically-propagated varieties.
Where the number of organically bred varieties are very limited or non-existent for certain crops,
conventionally bred varieties are allowed, except for varieties derived from genetic engineering (GMO
crops, Figure 11-1), which are not allowed in organic farming. However, the seeds of conventionally
bred varieties should be propagated under certified organic systems.
FIGURE 11-1 - HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK OF GMOCONTAMINATION
In order to improve the quality of organically propagated seed and plant material and to make the
propagation less risky, training of farmers’ groups that will specialize in this issue is required. Training
is needed in all aspects of propagation: maintenance breeding, avoidance of unwanted crosspollination, seed and plant health, phytosanitary issues of vegetative propagation, cleaning and
processing of seeds, short and long term storage, as well as marketing strategies. Seed production
should be combined with on-farm variety testing in order to provide as much information for farmers
as possible.
First, the kind of propagation needs to be determined: either those based on generative propagation or
sexual reproduction (seeds) such as lettuce, curly endive, pepper, eggplants, tomato, beans, etc.; or
those vegetative propagated (asexual reproduction) through another part of the plant: potato tubers,
sweet potato roots, bulbs in onion and garlic, cuttings in artichoke, stolons in strawberry, “spiders” or
roots in asparagus, etc.
SUMMARY
87
Despite the method of propagation to be used, all the seeds and plant material used should be free of
pathogens and weeds, and obtained from safe sources. Certified seeds are normally clean, but if such
seeds are not available to the farmers, the seeds should be treated before use to eliminate seed-borne
diseases (with a hot water treatment for example, Figure 11-2).The health of the seeds (while storage
period), seedlings, cuttings or other plant material used is crucial for preventing pests and diseases,
and to keep crop productivity (Figure 11-3).
FIGURE 11-2 - HOT WATER TREATMENTS FOR SEEDS
FIGURE 11-3 - PREVENTIVE MEASURES AGAINST STORAGE PESTS AND DISEASES
88
In the following sections, the considerations for seed evaluation, characterization and multiplication
will be discussed in details.
Farmers select seeds with specific characteristics to meet their particular needs: yield; quality like
colour, texture, flavour; adaptation to climate oscillations; resistance to pests and diseases; fodder
value; soil enrichment by nitrogen fixation or extensive root system; among others (Shiva et al. 2004).
Good quality seed is the sum of its genetic, physiological, physical and health traits. Concerning
genetic quality, the material should be of known origin, already tested in the region, and produced in
an isolated environment (separated from other varieties to prevent intercrossing). The seeds can be
bred by a plant breeder of by a farmer. When a farmer wants to select his own genetic material, he has
to bear many details in mind:
 Choose the best plants on the farm: vigorous growth, high yielding plants, good quality fruits
(shape, colour and flavour (when applicable)), best fruit covering, good health, etc.
 The selected plants should be looked after with the utmost care.
 Every plant not corresponding to the chosen type should be eliminated, and isolation distance
strictly respected.
 Neighbouring plants having pest or diseases must be eliminated.
 Fruits must be picked at optimum maturity.
 Once picked, the seeds should be taken out at once.
 For storage, the procedure will depend on the plant family:
In case of fresh tomato cultivars for example, the juice, seeds and placenta should be put in a
glass jar for fermentation for 24 to 48 hours fermentation, depending on ambient temperature,
to prevent bacterial cancrosis problems transmitted by seeds. If the seeds get pressed together,
the lumps should be taken apart by hand. The seeds is then stored in brown paper bags, with
diatomaceous earth or wood ashes. In the latter case, the ratio is 50% seeds and 50% ash.
When storage of grain such rice is needed, the best strategy is to sundry the seeds before
storage; sun dry should be carried-out at low air moisture. Before storage the grains should be
soaked in neem oil, as this helps keep away storage pests.
Physical quality comes from physical botanical purity. In this context, the farmers must keep in
mind that:
 Only pure seed of the selected species should be kept, free from foreign seeds. Great care must
be taken while picking lettuce, onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, to keep out weeds
with seeds, because separation later is very difficult.
 It should include the smallest possible amount of inert material (remains of flowers, fruits, etc.)
 It should have good weight and size, without mechanical damage (e.g. wild radish seeds are
very sensitive, their seed cuticle being very brittle during the seed cleaning process).
Health quality should be achieved by working-up a healthy, organic soil, rich in organic matter,
nutrients and microorganisms, so that plants grow healthy and without nutrient or physiological
imbalances that make them susceptible to pests and diseases. Strict control of unhealthy plants should
be established, so as not foster foci of infection and sources of inoculation brought from plant by insect
vectors.
89
 Traditional seeds are locally available because farmers collect good seeds from their own plots
and keep them for the next season.
 Farmers either buy or exchange their seed with other farmers or grow their own seeds.
Therefore the cost of seeds is minimal.
 Native seeds are geared to a subsistence economy as the farmers first grow food for his
subsistence and/or stock seed for the next season and market only the surplus.
 Native seeds embody indigenous knowledge. A farmer who uses native seeds use his/her
traditional knowledge, skills and wisdom to grow them, promoting self-reliance.
 An outstanding feature of native seeds is diversity.
 Native seeds are hardy, as they have, over the years, developed resistance to the pests and
diseases.
 Traditional seeds have high level of tolerance to conditions of stress and are adapted to local
agro-climatic conditions.
Farming communities have always implemented conservation methods known to the formal sector as
ex-situ (off-field) and in-situ (in-field) conservation strategies. In-situ conservation provides farmers a
valuable option for conserving crop biodiversity and helps to sustain evolutionary systems that are
responsible for the generation of genetic variability. This is especially significant in many parts of the
world subject to drought and other stresses, because it is under such environmental extremes that
variations useful for stress-resistance breeding are generated. In the case of diseases or pests, this
allows for continuing host-parasite co-evolution.
Also under these conditions, access to a wide diversity of local seeds probably provides the only
reliable source of planting material. The ability of such material to survive under to survive under
these stresses is conditioned by their inherent broad genetic base.
The seed system used in most traditional farming systems is based on the local production of seeds
by the farmers themselves. Farmers consistently retain seed as security measure to provide back-up
in case of crop failure.
Farmers practice seed selection, production and saving for informal distribution of planting material
within and among the farming communities. Community seed bank represents one strategy for a
collective maintenance of genetic diversity in crops/plant species. Low-cost community level seed
bank or seed storage facilities can help to preserve climate mitigating characteristics of traditional
varieties, while, at the same time, serving as a base material for farmers to select special lines to meet
their changing needs. They also play a role in improving market outlets through enabling communities
to produce crop of known quality and in stabilizing prices over changing situations. Thus, community
seed bank development contributes toward promoting economic empowerment of farmers.
Likewise, the establishment of species adapted to extreme environments in field gene banks at
strategic sites can provide a reserve for places where traditional crops may have completely failed.
Germ-plasm materials maintained in such fields could be distributed to rural farming communities or
for further investigation of their potential use in breeding programs to improve food security.

12. ANIMAL HUSBANDRY
IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE
Integrating animal husbandry into crop producing farms is one of the principles of organic farming. In
temperate and arid zones, animal husbandry plays an important role in the recycling of nutrients,
while it is less emphasised in the humid tropics. The caring, training, and nurturing of animals is
considered an art in many farming communities.
Integrating animals into a farm help creating a closed or semi-closed system where energy and
nutrients are recycled (Figure 12-1). Animals can convert non-edible biomass (e.g. grass, straw,
kitchen waste) into food, while increasing soil fertility with their manure.
FIGURE 12-1 - ANIMALS INTEGRATED INTO THE FARM, SHOWING THE FLOW OF FODDER, DUNG AND PRODUCTS
Many farm animals have a multi-functional role, for example (Figure 12-2):
→ Produce dung which is of great importance for soil fertility.
→ Yield products such as milk or eggs for sale or own consumption continuously.
→ Recycle by-products such as straw or kitchen waste.
→ Serve as draught animals for tillage or transport.
→ Produce meat, hides, feathers, horns etc.
→ Serve as an investment or a bank.
→ Help in pest control (e.g. dugs) and weed management (e.g. grazing on barren fields).
→ Have cultural or religious significance (prestige, ceremonies etc.).
→ Produce young stock for breeding or sale.
SUMMARY
92
FIGURE 12-2 - REASONS TO KEEP FARM ANIMALS - A COW IS NOT JUST A COW! FARM ANIMALS CAN HAVE MANY FUNCTIONS FOR A FARMER
The significance of each role will vary from animal to animal and from farm to farm. It will also depend
on the individual objectives of the farmer.
There are several reasons for taking up animal husbandry as a part of your farming activities or even
as the main one. There are also a number of critical aspects to be taken into consideration. In order to
make a decision on whether and how to get involved in animal husbandry, you should ask yourself a
number of questions:
Do I have sufficient space for shedding and grazing, sufficient fodder or by-products to feed, sufficient
know-how on keeping, feeding, and treating the specific kind of animals?
Can I use the dung in a suitable way? Will I get products for my own consumption or sales? Will the
animals somehow affect my crops?
Is sufficient labour available within or outside my farm? Is enough fodder and water of good quality
available throughout the year? Will remedies and veterinary support be available, if needed? Can I get
suitable breeds of animals?
Does anyone want to buy my milk, eggs, meat etc.? Is the price worth the effort? Am I able to compete
with other farmers?
93
Organic farmers try to achieve healthy farm animals which can produce satisfyingly over a long period
of time (Figure 12-3). To achieve this goal, various needs of farm animals have to be considered:
→ Fodder in adequate quality and quantity; for non-ruminants: diversity in fodder is usually
required.
→ Sufficient access to clean drinking water.
→ Clean sheds of sufficient size and with adequate light and fresh air.
→ Sufficient freedom to move around and perform their natural behaviour.
→ Healthy conditions and veterinary follow-up, when needed.
→ Sufficient contact with other animals, but no stress due to overcrowding.
→ For herd animals: an appropriate age and sex distribution within the herd.
FIGURE 12-3 - WHAT FARM ANIMALS NEED - FOR EXAMPLE CHICKENS HAVE VARIOUS NEEDS WHICH SHOULD BE FULFILLED SIMULTANEOUSLY
Organic animal husbandry means not only feeding organic food and avoiding synthetic food additives
and synthetic medicines (e.g. antibiotics, grow hormones), but also focusing on satisfying the various
needs of the farm animals. Good health and welfare of the animals are among the main objectives.
Suffering due to mutilations, permanent tethering or isolation of herd animals must be avoided as
much as possible. For various reasons, landless animal husbandry (i.e. fodder purchased from outside
the farm, no grazing land) is not permitted in organic farming.
In order to identify the appropriate number for a specific kind of animal on a farm, the following points
should be considered:
→ Availability of fodder on the farm, especially in periods of scarcity (e.g. dry season).
→ Carrying capacity of pastures.
→ Size of existing or planned sheds.
→ Maximum amount of manure the fields can bear.
→ Availability of labour for looking after the animals.
94
In tropical countries, farm animals are frequently found to be underfed. When defining the number of
farm animals, keep in mind that the economic benefit will be higher when fewer animals are kept, but
fed well. Not only the amount, but also the quality of the available food must be taken into
consideration.
The type of shed should be specific to the type of animals to be sheltered. Poultry, for instance, should
be housed in sheds that do not get too hot. Contact of the animals with their faeces should be avoided
as much as possible.
With the exception of nomadic lifestyles, most farm animals are temporarily kept in sheds. The
combination of animal husbandry and farm activities requires control of their movements so as to
avoid damage to crops. For the welfare and health of the animals, sheds must be cool and aerated, and
protect from rain (Figure 12-4).
They should be constructed in a way ensuring:
→ Sufficient space to lie down, stand up, move and express natural behaviour (e.g. licking,
scratching etc.).
→ Sufficient light (as a rule, one should be able to read a newspaper in the shed).
→ Protection from sunlight, rain, and extreme temperatures.
→ Sufficient aeration, but no draught.
→ Appropriate beddings (see section below).
→ Elements to exercise natural behaviour (e.g. for poultry: perching rails, sand baths and
secluded laying nests).
→ Sheltered pits or heaps to collect and store manure.
FIGURE 12-4 - TRADITIONAL SIMPLE SHEDS IN SENEGAL (CATTLE SHED, GOAT SHED, CHICKEN SHED)
For economic reasons, sheds can be built with simple, locally available materials. Many countries have
a rich tradition of shed constructions, and have developed the most efficient and appropriate shed
systems for the conditions of the region. If techniques of this heritage are combined with the above
principles, a locally adapted and at the same time animal friendly system may be obtained.
95
Beddings are materials used in sheds for keeping the floor soft, dry, and clean, which is important for
animal health. They absorb the excrements of the animals and need to be re-placed from time to time.
Beddings can be of straw, leaves, twigs, husks or other locally available material. They can be replaced
daily or kept for several months while adding fresh material on top.
The availability of fodder is one of the limiting factors in animal husbandry. Unlike landless systems in
conventional farming, organic husbandry should be mainly based on the fodder produced on the farm
itself. As is the case with humans, there is a direct link between the quantity and composition of the
food and the health status of the animals.
If farm animals are to be productive (milk, eggs, meat etc.), it is important that they get suitable food in
sufficient quantities. If the fodder production of one‘s farm is limited (which usually is the case), it
might be economically valid to keep less animals but supply them with sufficient food (Figure 12-5).
The appropriate quantity and the mix of feed items will of course depend on the type of animal, but
also on its main use (e.g. chicken for meat or egg production, cattle for milk, meat or draft etc.). In milk
production for example, cows producing milk should be given fresh grass and possibly other feed
items of sufficient protein content. On the same diet, draught animals would rapidly become exhausted.
A balanced diet will keep an animal healthy and productive. Whether or not a farm animal receives the
appropriate amount and kind of fodder usually can be seen by the shine of its hair or feathers. For
ruminants, a majority of the fodder should consist of roughage (grass, leaves). If concentrates or
supplements are used (e.g. agricultural by-products and wastes), they should not contain growth
promoters and other synthetic substances. Instead of buying expensive concentrates, there are a
variety of leguminous plants rich in protein which can be grown in the farm as cover crop, hedges or
trees. If mineral content in the available fodder is not sufficient to satisfy the animal‘s requirements,
mineral salt bricks or similar feed supplements can be used as long as they do not contain synthetic
additives.
FIGURE 12-5 - VARIETIES OF FODDER GRASSES AND LEGUMINOUS TREE PLANTS USED AS FODDER FOR CATTLE AND GOATS
96
In many regions of the tropics, favourable periods with abundant fodder alternate with less favourable
periods when there is almost nothing to feed to the animals. However, keeping animals means
providing fodder throughout the year. Fodder can be produced on the farm as grazing land or as grass
or tree crops used for cutting.
While grazing requires less labour than shed feeding, more land is needed and appropriate measures
to keep the animals away from other crops must be undertaken. Grazing may lead to a lower
productivity (milk, meat) but usually is the more favourable option concerning health and welfare of
the animals (Figure 12-6).
Shed keeping, however, has the advantage that the dung can be easily collected, stored, or composted
and applied to the crops. Whether grazing or shed feeding is the more suitable option will mainly
depend on the agro-climatic conditions, the cropping system, and the availability of land. A
combination of shed feeding and grazing in a fenced area may be an ideal combination of high
productivity and animal friendly husbandry. In extensive grass lands of semi-arid areas, however,
grazing may be the only suitable option.
FIGURE 12-6 - THE PROS AND CONS OF GRAZING AND SHED FEEDING, AND THE COMBINATION OF BOTH SYSTEMS AS A PROMISING OPTION
In most smallholder farms, fodder cultivation will compete for space with the cultivation of crops.
Whether fodder cultivation (and thus animal husbandry) is economically more beneficial compared
with crop production must be assessed case by case. However, there are some options for integrating
fodder crops in farms without sacrificing much land. Below are some examples:
→ Grass or leguminous cover crops in tree plantations
→ Hedges of suitable shrubs
→ Shade or support trees
→ Grass on bunds against soil erosion
→ Grass fallows or green manures in the crop rotation
→ Crops with by-products such as paddy straw or pea leaves
97
The management of pastures is crucial for a good herd management. It is also important to practice
appropriate management throughout the year. There are many different types of grasses, and every
climatic region has grasses which are specifically adapted to the conditions. In some cases it may be
worth considering to till the grazing site and sow grass varieties that are more appropriate to the
animal‘s needs.
Overgrazing is probably the most significant threat to grass land. Once the protective grass cover is
destroyed, the top soil is prone to erosion. Degraded pastures or land with little plant cover is difficult
to re-cultivate. Therefore, it is important that the use and intensity of grazing on a particular piece of
land is appropriate to its production capacity. Sufficient time must be given to a pasture to recover
after intensive grazing.
Fencing off of areas and rotation of the grazing animals on several pieces of land is the best option for
managing the farm and the overall landscape. Creating “grazing cells” restores overgrazed pastures,
reduce the incidence of intestinal parasites encountered while the animals graze, and increase land
productivity. The intensity and timing of grazing, as well as the cutting of the grass, will influence the
varieties of plants growing in the pasture (Figure 12-7).
FIGURE 12-7 - CATTLE GRAZING ON A PASTURE IN CUBA
Disease causing germs and parasites are present almost everywhere. Like humans, animals have an
immune system which is usually able to cope with these germs. And as with humans, the efficiency of
the immune system will be disturbed if animals are not properly fed, cannot practise their natural
behaviour, or are under social stress.
Health is a balance between disease pressure (the presence of germs and parasites) and the resistance
(immune system and self-healing forces) of the animal. The farmer can influence both sides of this
balance: reduce the quantity of germs by maintaining good hygiene, and strengthen the animal‘s
ability to cope with germs (Figure 12-8).
98
FIGURE 12-8 - BACTERIA, VIRUSES AND PARASITES ATTACKING THE FARM ANIMAL WHICH FIGHTS BACK WITH ITS IMMUNE SYSTEM.
THE FARMER CAN INFLUENCE BOTH SIDES OF THIS BALANCE
Organic animal husbandry puts its focus on improving the living conditions of animals and on
strengthening their immune systems. Of course: if an animal gets sick it must be treated. But the
farmer should also think about why the immune system of the animal was not able to fight the disease
or the parasite attack. And the farmer should think of ways to improve the animals living conditions
and hygiene in order to strengthen it.
Similar as in crop health, organic animal husbandry puts the main emphasis on preventive measures in
order to keep animals healthy, rather than on curative methods. This starts from keeping robust
breeds rather than high performing but very susceptible ones. Next, the conditions in which the
animals are kept should be optimal ones: sufficient space, light and air, dry and clean bedding,
frequent exercise (e.g. grazing) and proper hygiene.
The quality and quantity of fodder is of crucial importance for the health of the animal. Instead of
feeding commercial concentrates which make animals grow faster and produce more, a natural diet
appropriate to the requirements of the animal should be achieved. Where all these preventive
measures are taken, animals will rarely fall sick. Veterinary treatment thus should play only a
secondary role in organic farming. If treatment is necessary, alternative medicine based on herbal and
traditional remedies should be used. Only if these treatments fail or are not sufficient, synthetic
medicines (e.g. antibiotics, parasiticides, anaesthetics) may be used; in these cases, the treated animals
must be separated from non-treated organic stock and excluded for a period of time (e.g. at least 3
weeks) from organic certification..
The main principal for veterinary treatment in organic animal husbandry is: get to know the causes of
(or factors that favour) diseases in order to enhance the natural defence mechanisms of the animal
(and to prevent its manifestations in the future).
99
Unlike in crop production, synthetic means are allowed to cure sick animals if alternative treatment is
not sufficient. Here, reducing the suffering of the animal is given priority over the renunciation of
chemicals. However, the standards of organic agriculture clearly demand that priority is given to
management practices which encourage the resistance of the animals thus preventing the outbreak of
a disease. Therefore, an outbreak of a disease shall be considered as an indicator that the conditions
under which the animal is kept are not ideal. The farmer should try to identify the cause (or causes) of
the disease and prevent future outbreaks by changing management practices (Figure 12-9).
If conventional veterinary medication is applied, withholding periods must be adhered to before the
animal products can be sold as “organic”. This shall ensure that organic animal products are free from
residues of antibiotics etc. Synthetic growth promoters are not allowed in any case.
FIGURE 12-9 - PREVENTION BEFORE CURING -
ONLY WHEN ALL PREVENTIVE MEASURES FAIL ANIMALS SHOULD BE TREATED, PREFERABLY WITH ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES
Herbal medicines are widely used in many countries. Some traditional farming communities have a
vast knowledge of local plants and their healing properties. Plants can definitely support the healing
process, even if they do not eliminate the germ of the disease directly. Still, farmers should not forget
to identify the cause of the disease and also to re-think their management practises. For parasite
problems, changing the living conditions or the management of pastures will be more effective in the
long run than any treatment.
Example: Using Sweet Flag against parasites (Figure 12-10)
One example to use an herbal remedy against parasites is sweet flag (Acorus calamus). This plant
grows both in tropical as well as subtropical regions and is found on the banks of rivers and lakes and
in swampy ditches or marshes. The powdered dried rhizomes (thick root parts) act as an effective
insecticide against fowl lice, fleas and house flies.
100
FIGURE 12-10 - USING SWEET FLAG AGAINST PARASITES
Treating fowls infested by lice: Use around 15 g of powdered rhizome for an adult bird. For dusting the
bird with the powder, hold it by its feet upside down so that the feathers open and the dust will work
its way to the skin. The treatment is reported as being safe to the birds. The sweet flag powder is also
reported to be effective against house flies when dusted on fresh cow dung infested by fly maggots. It
further shall protect new-born calves of vermin infection if washed with a water infusion.
Attention! Herbal remedies against parasites can also have a toxic effect on the farm animals!
Therefore it is important to know the appropriate dose and application method!
As preventive measures for maintaining good animal health are of high relevance in organic farming,
the selection of breeds suitable to local conditions and to organic feeding is of crucial importance. This
requires that suitable breeds are available. Traditional breeds of farm animals may be a good starting
point for organic animal breeding. Animals can be improved by selection of individuals especially
suitable for organic conditions. They can be crossbred with suitable new breeds, thus achieving an
animal with the positive aspects of traditional breeds and the satisfying production of the new breeds.
For breeding, organic farming uses natural reproduction techniques. While artificial insemination is
allowed, embryo transfer, genetic manipulation, and hormonal synchronisation are not permitted
according to IFOAM standards.
Over the last decades, traditional breeds have been replaced by high performing ones in many regions.
Similar to high yielding plant varieties, these new breeds usually depend on a rich diet (concentrates)
and optimal living conditions. As high performing breeds in general are more susceptible to diseases
than traditional varieties, they need frequent veterinary interventions. Thus, these new breeds might
not be the right choice for small farmers, as the costs of food concentrates and veterinary treatment
are too high compared with what can be earned by selling the products.
In addition, for organic farmers the main animal product (e.g. milk) is not the only reason to keep
animals. Breeding activities therefore should try to optimise the overall performance of the animal, 
101
taking into consideration the different goals of an organic farmer. For example a poultry breed suitable
for organic smallholder farms might not be the one with the highest egg production, but one in which
meat production is good, and kitchen wastes and whatever is found on the farm yard can be used as
feed. Suitable cattle breeds would produce sufficient milk and meat while feeding mainly on roughage
and farm by-products (e.g. straw), be of high fertility and good resistance against diseases, if required,
they can also be used for draught and transport.
FIGURE 12-11 - BREEDING GOALS
When comparing the production of different breeds of cows, usually, only the production per day or
year is taken into consideration. However, high performing breeds usually have a shorter life span
than traditional ones with lower production. The life milk production of a cow giving, for example, 8
litres per day, but over 10 years, therefore would be greater than the one of a high-breed cow yielding
16 litres per day, but dies after 4 years.
As the investments to get a milk producing cow are quite high, i.e. the rearing and feeding of a calf or
the purchase of an adult cow, continuous production over a long life span should be of high interest to
the farmer. This should be reflected in the breeding goals, which so far mainly focus on the maximum
short term production. (Figure 12-12).
