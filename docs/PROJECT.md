# Project Description

Goal: provide small/independent farmers with affordable, AI-driven insights and actionable strategies for crop management, by combining real-time environmental data, market intelligence, and static agricultural knowledge.

Core components:

- Chatbot interface: conversational system for personalized advice and question-answering.
- Insights dashboard: data visualization portal showing real-time conditions, market trends, and forecasts.
- Passive data collection engine: continuously updates the structured database with live satellite, market, environmental, and weather data.
- Knowledge base: combines static agricultural knowledge (vector DB) + structured dynamic data (Postgres/Supabase) for reasoning and summarization.
